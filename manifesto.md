## Introduction

AMD's opportunity is blocked not by hardware, but by lost credibility with developers. The open-source community's trust is the key to unlocking AMD's value and breaking the current monopoly in GPU computing.

## The Real Obstacle: Credibility Crisis

Years of unmet promises, incomplete support, and lack of transparency have eroded trust in AMD among developers and the open-source community. Without credible, public, and sustained action, developers will not invest their time, contribute code, or build on AMD's platform. This credibility gap is the true bottleneck to AMD's success in AI and high-performance computing.

## Our Unique Approach: Shareholder Activism for Open Source

Unlike typical open source advocacy, our campaign leverages shareholder power. By filing a shareholder resolution, we can require AMD's Board to address credibility and accountability at the highest level. This mechanism creates real, public pressure for change that cannot be ignored or spun. It is a strategic tool to ensure AMD's commitments are credible, public, and sustained.

## Our Demands

To restore trust and unlock AMD's potential, we call on AMD to:

- Make credible, public, and ongoing commitments to open-source software development and support, such as publishing detailed roadmaps and progress reports.
- Establish transparent processes for engaging and incorporating input from developers and researchers, for example through a Developer Advisory Board or regular open forums.
- Implement Board-level oversight and transparent reporting, including tracking and disclosing key metrics on software compatibility, installation success, and user satisfaction.
- Provide clear and public support timelines for a broad range of GPUs, including consumer and academic hardware.

These demands are designed to be compatible with what is possible in a shareholder resolution under SEC rules: they focus on credibility, transparency, engagement, and accountability, not prescriptive technical or budgetary details.

## The Payoff: Breaking the CUDA Monopoly

If AMD restores trust and delivers on open GPU software, it can break NVIDIA's monopoly. This will unlock billions in value, end vendor lock-in, and support open innovation in AI and science. The upside is enormous—not just for AMD shareholders, but for the entire technology ecosystem.

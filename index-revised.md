# Breaking the GPU Lock: When Developers Become Shareholders

**What if developers had votes, not just voices?**

*This is the first campaign where developers unite with investors—combining technical expertise with shareholder power to break vendor lock-in at the boardroom level.*

## Why hasn't AMD broken the CUDA monopoly?

**It's not the hardware.** The MI300X was designed to compete directly with NVIDIA's H100 in AI workloads. AMD has powered the world's fastest supercomputers, including [systems like El Capitan and Frontier](https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/2024/11/) achieving exascale performance.

**The problem is software credibility.** Years of broken promises and unstable releases have destroyed developer trust, leaving NVIDIA with [massive market dominance](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html) despite having competitive alternatives.

## The Credibility Crisis: How Bad Is It?

ROCm is ["the Dark Souls of machine learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/)—technically possible, but brutally difficult. This isn't just an inconvenience; it can be a year of wasted effort for users like this one:

> "I've pretty much spent the entire year... trying to get the GPU to work with Stable diffusion... I tried getting it to work In Docker, In WSL, In virtualbox... and now I finally broke down and dual booted ubuntu. And still I can't get it to work... My Nvidia GPU always just worked. ... Buying the AMD GPU was the biggest mistake I've made in 20 yrs. and I'm not exaggerating at all." — A 3D artist on GitHub [[source](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2754)]

**This pattern repeats across thousands of developers.** GitHub issues, Reddit threads, HackerNews discussions—all filled with similar stories of weeks wasted on AMD setup failures. Even research institutions default to NVIDIA to avoid the software risk.

**This costs shareholders dearly.** AMD is missing out on the fastest-growing segment in tech—the [global AI chip market was valued at $52.92 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $295.56 billion by 2030](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/artificial-intelligence-chip-market), growing at a CAGR of 33.2%.

**This creates a vicious cycle:** AMD ships buggy software → developers get burned → they warn others → fewer people try AMD → less adoption → AMD can't find/fix bugs → repeat.

Now developers assume AMD won't work before they even try. [NVIDIA cracked this years ago](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/nvidias-winning-platform-strategy-with-cuda/) by winning developers first.

**AMD management can't fix this alone.** Hardware-first companies struggle with [organizational inertia](https://www.iese.edu/insight/articles/inertia-management-challenge-digital-transformation/)—what made them successful now blocks software transformation.

**Rebuilding trust requires external pressure—not just promises.**

But how do we create that pressure? The answer is coordination.

> **"NVIDIA's monopoly isn't fate. It's a coordination problem."**

We coordinate as owners, not just users.

This isn't just about fixing AMD's software—it's about breaking the most expensive monopoly in tech. Here's what's at stake for everyone involved:

## Why This Matters to *You*

**If you're building with AI:**
- You're paying the "NVIDIA tax" - [1,000% profit margins](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report) because there's no credible alternative
- Your technical choices are constrained by vendor lock-in
- Your compute budget is 2-3x higher than it should be

**If you're an investor:**
- Every portfolio company overpays for compute
- AMD is missing the fastest-growing segment in tech
- The AI chip market was $52.92B in 2024, projected to reach $295.56B by 2030

## The Strategy: Developers Become Owners

> **"This is not a petition. This is a lever."**

**We're done begging. We're voting.**

**AMD knows they're vulnerable.** Unlike NVIDIA's entrenched position, AMD is still fighting for market share. Their board faces pressure from all sides—investors demanding AI growth, customers frustrated with software, and competitors gaining ground. This makes them uniquely responsive to coordinated shareholder pressure.

Instead of filing GitHub issues that get ignored, we're filing shareholder resolutions that demand board-level responses. Instead of posting frustrated Reddit threads, we're pooling voting shares. Instead of being powerless users, we're becoming owners with legal leverage.

**How this works:**
- Developers and allies buy AMD shares (even one share = vote)
- We file a shareholder resolution demanding software accountability
- We rally other shareholders—institutional investors, pension funds, tech-focused funds—who also want AMD to succeed in AI
- Board must respond publicly to all shareholders
- Real leverage replaces empty promises

It's proven. Engine No. 1 won board seats at ExxonMobil with just 0.02% of shares. Small activist funds move giants by rallying other investors.

## Our Demands: Accountability, Not Excuses

**What exactly are we demanding?** Not vague promises, but concrete accountability:

To restore trust and unlock AMD's potential, we call on AMD to:

- **Make credible, public, and ongoing commitments** to open-source software development and support, such as publishing detailed roadmaps and progress reports
- **Establish transparent processes** for engaging and incorporating input from developers and researchers, for example through a Developer Advisory Board or regular open forums  
- **Implement Board-level oversight and transparent reporting**, including tracking and disclosing key metrics on software compatibility, installation success, and user satisfaction
- **Provide clear and public support timelines** for a broad range of GPUs, including consumer and academic hardware

These demands focus on credibility, transparency, engagement, and accountability—designed to be compatible with SEC shareholder resolution rules while addressing the core trust issues that prevent AMD adoption.

## The Payoff: Breaking the CUDA Monopoly

NVIDIA has [dominated AI training chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html) in a market that was $52.92B in 2024 and is projected to reach $295.56B by 2030. They command [1,000% profit margins](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report) on some chips—monopoly pricing that exists only because customers can't risk alternatives.

**When AMD restores software credibility, everything changes:**
- Enterprises escape the "NVIDIA tax" as real competition emerges
- Venture startups stop budgeting 2-3x for compute to avoid AMD risk  
- Developer productivity explodes as time shifts from fighting tools to building products
- Open source AI accelerates when alternatives to CUDA "just work"
- AMD captures meaningful share of the fastest-growing tech market in history

**This unlocks billions for AMD shareholders and breaks vendor lock-in across the entire industry.**

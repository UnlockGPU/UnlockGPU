# Breaking the GPU Lock: When Shareholders Amplify Developer Voices

**Developers speak. Shareholders vote. Together we break the lock.**

We are AMD shareholders turning real developer pain into board-level action.

## Why hasn't AMD broken the CUDA monopoly?

**Guess how many of the world's top 20 AI startups use something other than
NVIDIA?** Just one—and it's not using AMD. Yet 9 of the world's top 20
supercomputers run AMD silicon.[^gpu-count-method] 
Hardware is not the problem. AMD's MI300X competes directly with NVIDIA's H100,
and AMD powers the world's fastest supercomputers.

**The problem is broken trust.** Years of unstable releases and unfulfilled
promises have poisoned the developer ecosystem, leaving NVIDIA with [massive market dominance](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html)
despite AMD's competitive hardware.

## The Credibility Crisis: How Bad Is It?

ROCm is notoriously challenging—dubbed ["the Dark Souls of machine
learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/).
Possible, but painfully difficult. This costs users months or years of lost
productivity. One 3D artist shared on GitHub:

> "I've spent an entire year trying to get the GPU to work with Stable
Diffusion, experimenting with Docker, WSL, virtualbox, and even dual-booting
Ubuntu. It still doesn't work. My Nvidia GPU just worked. Buying AMD was the
biggest mistake I've made in 20 years."
[[source](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2754)]

Stories like this flood GitHub, Reddit, and HackerNews. Even major research
institutions default to NVIDIA to avoid software risks. 

**Here's the deeper problem: broken trust creates a vicious cycle.** When AMD
tries to engage the community, the best developers don't show up—or leave after
being burned. Fewer bug reports. Fewer fixes. Less adoption. **Fewer
libraries.** Even great hardware can't escape that gravity.

Community developers volunteer [unofficial ROCm
fixes](https://github.com/vladmandic/sdnext/wiki/AMD-ROCm) and [workaround
tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1kxfns9/possible_solution_for_amd_7000_series_gpu_driver/),
but these solutions stay scattered while users struggle with the same problems.
**The pattern is toxic:** talented developers learn that helping AMD means
wasting time, so they stop trying. Meanwhile, the entire market pays monopoly
prices because real competition can't emerge.

## Why This Matters—and What Happens When We Fix It

**Building with AI?** You're paying the **GPU Luxury Tax**—NVIDIA skims [1,000% profit margins](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report)
while locking you into constrained technical choices.

**Own AMD stock?** You're watching billions slip away as the company misses the
fastest-growing tech segment.

**End user?** You're stuck with artificially inflated prices because real
competition doesn't exist.

The AI chip market is worth **$50 B** today and projected to hit **$300 B by
2030**—yet one API still calls the shots.

**When AMD becomes genuinely reliable, everything shifts.** Enterprises escape
the *GPU Luxury Tax*. Startups stop budgeting extra for risk-mitigation
workarounds. Developer productivity explodes as time shifts from fighting tools
to building products. Open-source AI accelerates when CUDA alternatives "just
work."

**Result:** Billions for AMD shareholders and broken vendor lock-in across the
industry.

> **"NVIDIA's monopoly isn't fate. It's a coordination problem."**

Coordination problems can be solved. The solution is converting frustrated
voices into voting power.

## The Strategy: From Voice to Vote to Solutions

For years, developers have had **voice without power**. GitHub issues get ignored. Reddit threads change nothing. Frustrations without force.

**Shareholder activism changes the equation.** When developers become shareholders, voice becomes vote. Engine No. 1 replaced three ExxonMobil board members with just 0.02% ownership—proving that tiny stakes can create massive impact when strategically deployed. **Here's our breakthrough:** We'll convert every bug report, blocked workload, and lost deal into boardroom pressure. Real leverage replaces empty promises.

**Our approach has two phases:** First, force the Board to admit the crisis exists—much easier than forcing them to fix it, and SEC rules favor governance proposals over operational mandates. Once they're on record, we hit them with public solutions: developer advisory boards, community partnerships, real accountability. We start with two straightforward demands that transform developer frustration into shareholder leverage:

## Our Demands: Board Accountability on the Crisis

We're targeting governance, not engineering—forcing the Board to acknowledge and manage the credibility crisis that's costing shareholders billions.

### 1. Acknowledge the Risk
**The Board must produce a comprehensive risk assessment of how AMD's GPU software credibility crisis threatens shareholder value.**

### 2. Show Your Work  
**The Board must annually disclose how they oversee GPU software quality and developer adoption.**

## Why These Demands Work

**The Board has been silent on a $300B opportunity.** Time to make some noise. Our approach is surgical: hit governance, not engineering. SEC rules favor transparency proposals over operational mandates, so we're forcing accountability where it hurts—board oversight. Once they're on record admitting the crisis, we can leverage that admission in public letters suggesting concrete solutions.

**Every broken installation is evidence.** Every abandoned ROCm project. Every developer who gave up and bought NVIDIA. That's not just frustration—it's material shareholder risk the Board should have been managing. When we force them to quantify the exodus and map the threat, they can't hide behind vague "software investment" promises anymore. When we demand governance metrics, they have to show their work—or admit they've been asleep at the wheel.

**Here's the genius:** Once disclosed, this becomes public record. Public scrutiny. Ongoing accountability. No more quarterly hand-waving about developer adoption without concrete oversight metrics. **The vicious cycle breaks** when the Board finally owns the crisis instead of ignoring it.

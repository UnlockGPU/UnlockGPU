**Unlock the GPU: A developer‚Äìinvestor alliance, can force AMD to fix its software and break Nvidia's monopoly.**

This is the first campaign where developers become investors‚Äîuniting with existing shareholders to act as owners and demand real change at the boardroom level.

## Why hasn't AMD broken the CUDA monopoly?

**It's not the hardware.** The [MI300X competes with Nvidia's H100](https://semianalysis.com/2025/05/23/amd-vs-nvidia-inference-benchmark-who-wins-performance-cost-per-million-tokens/) on AI benchmarks. AMD has powered the world's fastest supercomputers, including [dominating the Top500 rankings](https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/11/18/amd-now-has-more-compute-on-the-top500-than-nvidia/) with systems like El Capitan and Frontier.

**The problem is software credibility.** Years of broken promises and unstable releases have destroyed developer trust, leaving NVIDIA with [massive market dominance](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html) despite having competitive alternatives.

## The Credibility Crisis: How Bad Is It?

ROCm is ["the Dark Souls of machine learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/)‚Äîtechnically possible, but brutally difficult. This isn't just an inconvenience; it's a year of wasted effort for users like this one:

> "I've pretty much spent the entire year... trying to get the GPU to work with Stable diffusion... I tried getting it to work In Docker, In WSL, In virtualbox... and now I finally broke down and dual booted ubuntu. And still I can't get it to work... My Nvidia GPU always just worked. ... Buying the AMD GPU was the biggest mistake I've made in 20 yrs. and I'm not exaggerating at all." ‚Äî A 3D artist on GitHub [[source](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2754)]

**This pattern repeats across thousands of developers.** GitHub issues, Reddit threads, HackerNews discussions‚Äîall filled with similar stories of weeks wasted on AMD setup failures. Even research institutions default to NVIDIA to avoid the software risk.

**This creates a vicious cycle:** AMD ships buggy software ‚Üí developers get burned ‚Üí they warn others ‚Üí fewer people try AMD ‚Üí less adoption ‚Üí AMD deprioritizes improvements ‚Üí repeat.

Now developers assume AMD won't work before they even try.

**AMD management can't fix this alone.** Rebuilding trust requires public accountability and external pressure‚Äînot just promises. The company needs credible commitments that developers can actually believe.

Only pressure from owners can force management to make the credible, public commitments needed to rebuild trust.

> "NVIDIA's monopoly isn't fate. It's a coordination problem."

## Our Weapon: Shareholder Activism

> "This is not a petition. This is a lever."

**We file a resolution, not a petition.** Real power. Real leverage. We force AMD's Board to address credibility and accountability at the highest level.

**It works.** Engine No. 1 won board seats at ExxonMobil with just 0.02% of shares. Small activist funds can move giants by rallying other investors.

**Result:** Public pressure AMD can't ignore or spin away. Credible, sustained commitments the developer community can actually trust.

## Our Demands

To restore trust and unlock AMD's potential, we call on AMD to:

- Make credible, public, and ongoing commitments to open-source software development and support, such as publishing detailed roadmaps and progress reports.
- Establish transparent processes for engaging and incorporating input from developers and researchers, for example through a Developer Advisory Board or regular open forums.
- Implement Board-level oversight and transparent reporting, including tracking and disclosing key metrics on software compatibility, installation success, and user satisfaction.
- Provide clear and public support timelines for a broad range of GPUs, including consumer and academic hardware.

These demands focus on credibility, transparency, engagement, and accountability.[^1]

## The Payoff: Breaking the CUDA Monopoly

**The economics are staggering.** NVIDIA has [dominated AI training chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html) in a market that hit $500B and continues growing exponentially. They command [1,000% profit margins](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report) on some chips‚Äîmonopoly pricing that exists only because customers can't risk alternatives.

**When AMD restores software credibility, everything changes:**
- Enterprises escape the "NVIDIA tax" as real competition emerges
- Venture startups stop budgeting 2-3x for compute to avoid AMD risk  
- Developer productivity explodes as time shifts from fighting tools to building products
- Open source AI accelerates when alternatives to CUDA "just work"
- AMD captures meaningful share of the fastest-growing tech market in history

**This unlocks billions for AMD shareholders and breaks vendor lock-in across the entire industry.**

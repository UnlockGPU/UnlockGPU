# Breaking the GPU Lock: When Shareholders Amplify Developer Voices

**Developers speak. Shareholders vote. Together we break the lock.**

*We are AMD shareholders turning real developer pain into board-level action.*

**Guess how many of the world's top 20 AI startups use something other than NVIDIA?**  
**Just one—and it's not AMD.** Meanwhile, **13 of the world's top 20 supercomputers run AMD silicon.[^gpu-count-method]**

[^gpu-count-method]: Full tables and sourcing in our report: [“Supercomputers vs. AI Startups: GPU/Compute Provider Table (2025)”](/reports/ai-supercomputer-vs-startup-gpu-table).

## Why hasn't AMD broken the CUDA monopoly?

It's not the hardware. AMD's MI300X competes directly with NVIDIA's H100, and AMD powers the world's fastest supercomputers.

**The problem is broken trust.** Years of unstable releases and unfulfilled promises have poisoned the developer ecosystem, leaving NVIDIA with [massive market dominance](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html) despite AMD's competitive hardware.

## The Credibility Crisis: How Bad Is It?

ROCm is notoriously challenging—dubbed ["the Dark Souls of machine learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/). Possible, but painfully difficult. This costs users months or years of lost productivity. One 3D artist shared on GitHub:

> "I've spent an entire year trying to get the GPU to work with Stable Diffusion, experimenting with Docker, WSL, virtualbox, and even dual-booting Ubuntu. It still doesn't work. My Nvidia GPU just worked. Buying AMD was the biggest mistake I've made in 20 years." [[source](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2754)]

Stories like this flood GitHub, Reddit, and HackerNews. Even major research institutions default to NVIDIA to avoid software risks. 

**Here's the deeper problem: broken trust creates a toxic cycle.** When AMD tries to engage the community, the best developers don't show up—or leave after being burned. Fewer bug reports. Fewer fixes. Less adoption. **Fewer libraries.** Even great hardware can't escape that gravity.

Community developers volunteer [unofficial ROCm fixes](https://github.com/vladmandic/sdnext/wiki/AMD-ROCm) and [workaround tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/1kxfns9/possible_solution_for_amd_7000_series_gpu_driver/), but these solutions stay scattered while users struggle with the same problems. **The pattern is toxic:** talented developers learn that helping AMD means wasting time, so they stop trying. Meanwhile, the entire market pays monopoly prices because real competition can't emerge.

## Why This Matters—and What Happens When We Fix It

**Building with AI?** You're paying what we call the **GPU Luxury Tax**—NVIDIA skims [1,000% profit margins](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report) while locking you into constrained technical choices.

**Own AMD stock?** You're watching billions slip away as the company misses the fastest-growing tech segment.

**End user?** You're stuck with artificially inflated prices because real competition doesn't exist.

The AI chip market is worth **$52.92 B** today and projected to hit **$295.56 B by 2030**—yet one API still calls the shots.

**When AMD becomes genuinely reliable, everything shifts.** Enterprises escape the GPU Luxury Tax. Startups stop budgeting 2–3× extra for risk-mitigation workarounds. Developer productivity explodes as time shifts from fighting tools to building products. Open-source AI accelerates when CUDA alternatives "just work."

**Result:** Billions for AMD shareholders and broken vendor lock-in across the industry.

> **"NVIDIA's monopoly isn't fate. It's a coordination problem."**

Coordination problems can be solved. The solution is converting frustrated voices into voting power.

## The Strategy: From Voice to Vote

For years, developers have had voice without power. GitHub issues get ignored. Reddit threads change nothing. Frustrations without force.

**Here's the breakthrough:** Developer frustration is data, and shareholder resolutions turn that data into leverage. We'll turn bug reports, blocked workloads, and lost deals into boardroom mandates. Voice becomes vote. Engine No. 1 won board seats at ExxonMobil through focused shareholder action. **Real leverage replaces empty promises.**

## Our Demands: Accountability, Not Excuses

To restore trust and unlock AMD's potential, we demand concrete accountability:

- **Credible Commitments** — Public roadmaps and progress reports for GPU software libraries and downstream ecosystem support
- **Developer Engagement** — Transparent processes like Developer Advisory Boards and regular open forums
- **Board Oversight** — Track and disclose key metrics: software compatibility, installation success, user satisfaction
- **Clear Timelines** — Public support commitments for consumer and academic GPUs

These demands target the core trust issues that prevent AMD adoption while staying within SEC shareholder resolution guidelines.

## How You Can Help

**Every broken installation. Every abandoned project. Every time you paid the GPU Luxury Tax. This is how we fix it—not as users begging for scraps, but as owners demanding results.**

**💻 Share your story** — Add to our [Developer Priorities](/priorities/). Your experience is our evidence.

**🗳️ Pledge your shares** — Join the voting bloc (even a single share counts). Every vote tightens our leverage.

**🚀 Amplify the signal** — Share with founders, angels, and fellow developers who get it.

# Breaking the GPU Lock: When Developers Become Shareholders

**What if every developer frustrated with AMD's broken GPU software could vote to fix it at the board level?**

*This is the first campaign where developers unite with investors—combining technical expertise with shareholder power to break vendor lock-in at the boardroom level.*

## The Pain You Know Too Well

Every GPU developer has this story. Maybe it's yours:

> "I've pretty much spent the entire year... trying to get the GPU to work with Stable diffusion... I tried getting it to work In Docker, In WSL, In virtualbox... and now I finally broke down and dual booted ubuntu. And still I can't get it to work... My Nvidia GPU always just worked. ... Buying the AMD GPU was the biggest mistake I've made in 20 yrs. and I'm not exaggerating at all." — A 3D artist on GitHub [[source](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/2754)]

This isn't just one person's frustration—it's thousands of developers, researchers, and startups.

ROCm is ["the Dark Souls of machine learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/)—technically possible, but brutally punishing. GitHub issues overflow with similar stories. HackerNews threads become support groups. Reddit becomes a cemetery of abandoned AMD setups.

The pattern is always the same: AMD's hardware looks amazing on paper → developers try it → software breaks → they warn everyone → adoption dies.

> **"NVIDIA's monopoly isn't fate. It's a coordination problem."**

Coordination problems need leverage that aligns everyone's incentives. When developers become shareholders, AMD's success becomes our success—and our leverage becomes their imperative.

## Why This Matters to *You*

**If you're building with AI:**
- You're paying the "NVIDIA tax" - [1,000% profit margins](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report) because there's no credible alternative
- Your technical choices are constrained by vendor lock-in
- Your compute budget is 2-3x higher than it should be

**If you're an investor:**
- Every portfolio company overpays for compute
- AMD is missing the fastest-growing segment in tech
- The AI chip market was $30B in 2024, projected to reach $400B+ by 2030

**AMD has the hardware.** The [MI300X competes with NVIDIA's H100](https://semianalysis.com/2025/05/23/amd-vs-nvidia-inference-benchmark-who-wins-performance-cost-per-million-tokens/) on benchmarks. AMD powers [the world's fastest supercomputers](https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/11/18/amd-now-has-more-compute-on-the-top500-than-nvidia/).

**But software credibility is destroyed.** Years of broken promises created a vicious cycle: buggy releases → developer flight → fewer users → fewer bug reports → worse software → repeat.

**And AMD knows they're vulnerable.** Unlike NVIDIA's entrenched position, AMD is still fighting for market share. Their board faces pressure from all sides—investors demanding AI growth, customers frustrated with software, and competitors gaining ground. This makes them uniquely responsive to coordinated shareholder pressure.

## The Strategy: Developers Become Owners

> **"This is not a petition. This is a lever."**

**We're done begging. We're voting.**

Instead of filing GitHub issues that get ignored, we're filing shareholder resolutions that demand board-level responses. Instead of posting frustrated Reddit threads, we're pooling voting shares. Instead of being powerless users, we're becoming owners with legal leverage.

**How this works:**
- Developers and allies buy AMD shares (even one share = voice)
- We file a shareholder resolution demanding software accountability
- We rally other shareholders—institutional investors, pension funds, tech-focused funds—who also want AMD to succeed in AI
- Board must respond publicly to all shareholders
- Real leverage replaces empty promises

It's proven. Engine No. 1 won board seats at ExxonMobil with just 0.02% of shares. Small activist funds move giants by rallying other investors.

## Our Demands: Accountability, Not Excuses

**What exactly are we demanding?** Not vague promises, but concrete accountability:

To restore trust and unlock AMD's potential, we call on AMD to:

- **Make credible, public, and ongoing commitments** to open-source software development and support, such as publishing detailed roadmaps and progress reports
- **Establish transparent processes** for engaging and incorporating input from developers and researchers, for example through a Developer Advisory Board or regular open forums  
- **Implement Board-level oversight and transparent reporting**, including tracking and disclosing key metrics on software compatibility, installation success, and user satisfaction
- **Provide clear and public support timelines** for a broad range of GPUs, including consumer and academic hardware

These demands focus on credibility, transparency, engagement, and accountability—designed to be compatible with SEC shareholder resolution rules while addressing the core trust issues that prevent AMD adoption.

> **"Your credibility is our leverage. These shares give us the vote."**

## The Payoff: Breaking the CUDA Monopoly

When AMD restores software credibility, everything changes:

💰 For the market: Real competition breaks monopoly pricing across the fastest-growing tech sector  
🚀 For startups: Compute costs drop, innovation accelerates  
🔓 For developers: Time shifts from fighting tools to building products  
🌍 For open source: AI development explodes when alternatives "just work"  
📈 For AMD shareholders: Capture meaningful share of the fastest-growing tech market

This unlocks billions in value and breaks vendor lock-in across the entire AI ecosystem.

**Research Objective:** Generate a comprehensive background report on researcher experiences and sentiment toward AMD GPU software and hardware, focusing on adoption in academic, scientific, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments.

**Scope & Timeline:**
- Primary focus: 2022-2025 (recent research use cases, pain points, and successes)
- Secondary: Historical context from 2018-2021 for trend analysis
- Include perspectives from university labs, research institutes, and national supercomputing centers

**Key Areas to Investigate:**
1. **ROCm and OpenCL adoption** in research/HPC
2. **Compatibility with scientific computing frameworks** (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, GROMACS, LAMMPS, OpenMM, etc.)
3. **Performance and scalability** in cluster/supercomputer environments
4. **Driver and software stack stability** for research workloads
5. **Documentation and support** for advanced/research use cases
6. **Experiences with grant-funded hardware purchases** and institutional IT support
7. **Barriers to porting existing CUDA/NVIDIA-based research code**

**Sources to Search:**
- **Academic forums and mailing lists:** (e.g., research computing, university HPC)
- **GitHub issues/discussions:** for scientific software projects
- **Supercomputing center user documentation and user group meetings**
- **Conference proceedings:** (e.g., SC, ISC, domain-specific conferences)
- **ResearchGate, arXiv, and institutional reports**
- **HPC and research computing Slack/Discord channels**

**Specific Pain Points to Document:**
- Installation and setup difficulties in research/HPC environments
- Performance and scalability issues compared to NVIDIA/CUDA
- Compatibility with scientific software and libraries
- Documentation gaps for advanced/research use cases
- Support for multi-GPU and distributed computing
- Driver/software stack stability for long-running jobs
- Barriers to porting and maintaining research code
- Institutional IT and procurement challenges

**Analysis Framework:**
1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Categorize opinions as Positive/Neutral/Negative with reasoning
2. **Pain Point Frequency:** Rank most commonly mentioned issues
3. **Solution Suggestions:** Collect researcher-proposed fixes and improvements
4. **Success Stories:** Document published results and cases where AMD GPUs worked well
5. **Trend Analysis:** Compare recent vs. historical sentiment
6. **Demographic Insights:** Field of research, region, institution type

**Output Structure:**
- Executive Summary (key findings, overall sentiment trend)
- Detailed Pain Points Analysis (with specific research examples and quotes)
- Researcher Solution Recommendations (community-suggested improvements)
- Competitive Analysis (NVIDIA/CUDA vs. AMD/ROCm in research)
- Market Opportunity Assessment (unmet needs, potential wins in academia/HPC)
- Appendix: Raw data, sources, methodology

**Special Focus Areas:**
- Barriers to adoption in academic and research settings
- Experiences of supercomputing centers and research labs
- Open source project maintainer perspectives
- Impact on early-career researchers and smaller institutions
- Regional differences in adoption and sentiment

**Quality Criteria:**
- Prioritize recent, detailed technical feedback over generic complaints
- Include both positive and negative perspectives for balance
- Focus on actionable, specific issues rather than vague criticisms
- Verify claims where possible with technical documentation or published results
- Distinguish between hardware and software-related issues

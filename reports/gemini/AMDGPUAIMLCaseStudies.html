class="c35 doc-content"><p class="c2"><span class="c29 c32"></span></p><h1 class="c0"><span class="c18">An Analytical Report on Companies Utilizing AMD GPUs: Documented Challenges in AI/ML Workloads</span></h1><p class="c2"><span class="c18"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c18"></span></p><h2 class="c0"><span class="c24">Executive Summary</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c24"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">This report provides a comprehensive analysis of companies and organizations that have utilized or attempted to utilize AMD GPUs for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) workloads, focusing on documented complaints related to software maturity, reliability, and ecosystem gaps. While AMD has made significant strides in hardware performance, particularly with its Instinct series, and has secured key partnerships with hyperscalers for large-scale inference, a persistent and widespread pattern of software immaturity, driver instability, and ecosystem deficiencies continues to impede broader adoption. This is particularly evident for AI model training workloads and among general developers, academic institutions, and smaller enterprises.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">A notable observation is the &quot;Hyperscaler Paradox&quot;: major cloud providers and AI companies such as Meta and Microsoft have deployed AMD Instinct GPUs in production for specific inference tasks.</span><span class="c16">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This adoption is often driven by AMD&#39;s compelling hardware advantages, such as larger High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) capacity, which can be crucial for large language model (LLM) inference by enabling larger models to fit on fewer GPUs and potentially reducing total cost of ownership.</span><span class="c16">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;However, this positive deployment often necessitates substantial internal engineering efforts and custom software development to optimize the AMD ROCm software stack and overcome its broader ecosystem limitations.</span><span class="c16">6</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This contrasts sharply with the experiences of academic institutions and individual developers, who frequently encounter critical tooling failures, performance regressions, and compatibility hurdles that lead to frustration and, in many cases, abandonment of AMD hardware in favor of NVIDIA&#39;s more mature CUDA ecosystem.</span><span class="c7">9</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">The recurring complaints center on the fragility of the ROCm software, including frequent crashes of profiling tools, fragmented support for consumer-grade GPUs, and significant performance degradation in critical AI operations like Flash Attention. The overall developer experience is often described as challenging, requiring extensive debugging and manual workarounds. These issues translate into tangible business impacts, including project delays, increased operational costs due to resource misallocation, and decisions to switch vendors. While AMD acknowledges these software gaps and is actively investing in improvements and acquisitions, the current state of its AI/ML software ecosystem presents a considerable barrier to widespread, frictionless adoption beyond highly resourced hyperscalers.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">Table 1 provides a high-level overview of the documented cases and their primary challenges.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c14 c29">Table 1: Summary of Companies and Key AMD GPU Challenges/Experiences</span></p><table class="c30"><tr class="c20"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Company Name / Organization</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Industry / Sector</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Size</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">AMD Hardware Used</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Primary AI/ML Use Case</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Key Complaint/Experience Summary</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Source</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c20"><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c22">Microsoft Azure</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Cloud Provider</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Enterprise</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">AMD Instinct MI300X</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">GPT4 Inferencing</span></p></td><td class="c6" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c12"><span class="c11">Achieved &quot;market leading price-performance,&quot;

These accelerators have become the cornerstone for training and deploying complex AI models, from convolutional neural networks to large language models. For years, NVIDIA has held a dominant position in this domain, largely due to its proprietary CUDA platform, which has fostered a comprehensive and deeply integrated ecosystem of software libraries, development tools, and widespread community support. This established ecosystem, often referred to as the &quot;CUDA moat,&quot; represents a significant barrier to entry for competitors and a strong incentive for developers to remain within NVIDIA&#39;s orbit.</span><span class="c7">6</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">In response to this market dynamic and the burgeoning demand for diversified compute options, AMD has strategically intensified its efforts in the AI/ML space. The company&#39;s push is centered around its Instinct series GPUs, designed for data center and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, and its open-source ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) software stack. AMD positions ROCm as a flexible, open alternative to CUDA, aiming to liberate customers from vendor lock-in and foster innovation through community collaboration.</span><span class="c16">21</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The company highlights its hardware advantages, such as the large memory capacity of its Instinct GPUs, which can be particularly beneficial for memory-intensive AI workloads like LLM inference.</span><span class="c7">1</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">However, the success of any GPU platform in AI/ML extends beyond raw hardware specifications. The maturity and reliability of the software stack, coupled with the breadth and depth of its supporting ecosystem, are equally, if not more, critical for enabling seamless development, deployment, and scaling of AI applications in production environments. An open-source approach, while appealing in principle, does not automatically translate into a mature or user-friendly ecosystem. The historical context reveals that AMD&#39;s &quot;open source&quot; advantage has often been undermined by practical challenges related to software quality assurance, fragmented hardware support, and a less developed developer experience compared to NVIDIA&#39;s decades-long investment in CUDA.</span><span class="c16">3</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This report will delve into specific instances where AMD&#39;s AI/ML offerings have encountered significant challenges in these crucial software and ecosystem dimensions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h2 class="c0"><span class="c24">Case Studies: Documented Challenges with AMD GPUs in AI/ML Workloads</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c24"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">This section provides detailed case studies of companies, organizations, and individual users who have encountered specific complaints and challenges when attempting to leverage AMD GPUs for AI/ML workloads. Each case highlights issues related to software maturity, reliability, and ecosystem gaps, supported by verifiable sources.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Cloud Providers and Infrastructure</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">While major cloud providers are beginning to integrate AMD Instinct GPUs, their experiences often underscore the necessity of significant internal engineering to overcome software and ecosystem limitations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Microsoft Azure</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Microsoft Azure has integrated AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs into its infrastructure for AI workloads. According to an AMD Community Blog, Microsoft achieved &quot;market leading price-performance for GPT4 inferencing&quot; using these accelerators.</span><span class="c16">2</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This statement, while positive from AMD&#39;s perspective, requires contextual understanding. Independent analysis from SemiAnalysis, a research and consultancy firm, has indicated that AMD&#39;s software stack, ROCm, has &quot;massively degraded AMD&#39;s performance&quot; on the MI300X in other contexts due to a &quot;lack of testing from AMD&quot; and a &quot;weaker-than-expected software Quality Assurance (QA) culture&quot;.</span><span class="c16">8</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This suggests that for Microsoft to achieve &quot;market leading price-performance&quot; with AMD hardware, it likely involved substantial internal engineering investment to optimize the software stack and work around existing limitations, rather than a simple out-of-the-box deployment. The ability of a hyperscaler like Microsoft to dedicate such resources allows them to unlock the hardware&#39;s potential despite general software immaturity, a luxury not afforded to all enterprises.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Meta (Facebook AI)</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Meta, a leading AI/ML company, has adopted AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs as the &quot;exclusive inferencing solution for their frontier Llama 405B model&quot; in live traffic, primarily due to the MI300X&#39;s large memory capacity, which can reduce the number of GPUs required to run a model.</span><span class="c16">1</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;However, Meta&#39;s approach to multi-vendor GPU utilization reveals underlying ecosystem challenges. Meta AI developed and open-sourced AITemplate (AIT), a &quot;unified inference system with separate acceleration back ends for both AMD and NVIDIA GPU hardware&quot;.</span><span class="c16">7</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Meta&#39;s rationale for developing AIT was to address the &quot;limited flexibility when choosing a high-performance GPU inference solution because these are concentrated in platform-specific, and closed black box runtimes.&quot; They observed that a machine learning system designed for one vendor&#39;s GPU often needed to be &quot;completely reimplemented&quot; for another, leading to difficulties in code iteration, maintenance, and debugging.</span><span class="c7">7</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">Meta&#39;s decision to build its own abstraction layer, AITemplate, is a crucial indicator. It demonstrates that while AMD hardware offers compelling advantages for specific workloads, its native software ecosystem and the broader industry&#39;s reliance on proprietary solutions necessitated a significant internal software development effort from Meta to achieve the desired level of flexibility and performance across different GPU vendors. This substantial engineering investment highlights the overhead required by large enterprises to achieve multi-vendor GPU flexibility and optimize performance, rather than finding a plug-and-play solution.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">TensorWave</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">TensorWave, an AMD-backed AI GPU cluster provider, has strategically focused on deploying AMD Instinct MI325X GPUs, emphasizing their significant memory advantage (128GB HBM3 per card) over comparable NVIDIA offerings.</span><span class="c16">3</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A machine learning researcher at a financial services firm, quoted by CTOL.Digital, stated that &quot;The memory capacity differential is crucial... Many of our models are limited by memory, not raw compute power. Having that extra breathing room makes previously impossible workloads suddenly feasible&quot;.</span><span class="c7">3</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Despite this hardware-driven differentiation, TensorWave explicitly acknowledges the software and ecosystem challenges. The company&#39;s blog states that AMD&#39;s ROCm, &quot;while improving, still lacks the ubiquity and developer familiarity of Nvidia&#39;s platform&quot;.</span><span class="c16">3</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;They also identify &quot;Software and Ecosystem Maturity&quot; as &quot;one of the biggest hurdles AMD has to cross&quot; and note that &quot;Compatibility and Developer Learning Curve&quot; require &quot;adapting models and restructuring approaches&quot; for customers.</span><span class="c16">5</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This indicates that while AMD GPUs can attract customers for specific, memory-intensive workloads, their adoption still comes with a recognized burden on the customer&#39;s side in terms of software adaptation and developer training.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">AI/ML Companies and Research Labs</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">Beyond hyperscalers, other AI/ML companies and the broader developer community face more direct and impactful challenges with AMD&#39;s software and ecosystem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Hugging Face (User of SFTTrainer)</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">A user on the Hugging Face Discuss forum reported significant issues when attempting to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) using distributed data parallelism (DDP) with the Accelerate library on two AMD GPUs with ROCm. The user consistently encountered &quot;out of memory (OOM) errors&quot; despite the fine-tuning process running successfully on a single GPU.</span><span class="c16">15</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Additionally, the user noted &quot;garbled output&quot; when using multiple AMD GPUs.</span><span class="c16">15</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This specific complaint highlights a critical gap in ROCm&#39;s maturity for distributed training. While AMD emphasizes its HPC capabilities and future rack-scale solutions, real-world user experiences with popular ML frameworks like Hugging Face&#39;s Accelerate demonstrate fundamental issues with multi-GPU communication and memory management, leading to OOM errors and corrupted output. This directly impedes the ability to scale AI/ML workloads effectively on AMD hardware, impacting research and development velocity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Stability AI (via community user experiences)</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Numerous community users attempting to run AI/ML workloads, particularly Stable Diffusion for image generation and LLM inference, on AMD consumer GPUs have reported a consistently challenging and frustrating experience.

Despite the processor being marketed as &quot;AI series&quot; and Framework&#39;s own marketing mentioning ROCm support, the user was &quot;sadly&quot; unable to get PyTorch to work with ROCm on the Radeon 890M.</span><span class="c16">11</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;AMD&#39;s response to support requests reportedly pointed users to &quot;third-party patches&quot;.</span><span class="c16">11</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">rocminfo tool, designed to detect ROCm-enabled devices, only recognized the CPU as a ROCm agent, not the integrated GPU.</span><span class="c7">11</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">This situation highlights a critical disconnect: while the processor includes an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for AI, the GPU component, which is often crucial for broader AI/ML frameworks like PyTorch, lacked direct ROCm support. The user noted that &quot;AMD&#39;s fragmented support for ROCm is one of the key reason NVIDIA has and continues to dominate the AI space. CUDA works on almost any NVIDIA GPU going back years&quot;.</span><span class="c16">11</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This case demonstrates how misleading marketing and fragmented software support for integrated and consumer-grade GPUs can lead to significant user frustration and undermine confidence in AMD&#39;s AI capabilities, particularly among individual developers and students.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Physicist (Individual)</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">An individual physicist, accustomed to a robust CUDA-based HPC setup at work, attempted to explore AMD ROCm at home using an RX 5700XT card. After &quot;years&quot; of trying to run simple ROCm projects, the individual &quot;eventually gave up&quot;.</span><span class="c16">17</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This experience highlights a broader sentiment among developers who struggle with AMD&#39;s ecosystem, with one user stating they were &quot;very close to buying multiple used NVIDIA P40s instead&quot; due to the pain of using AMD.</span><span class="c16">17</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Another user echoed this, noting they were &quot;so close to buying a 16GB AMD GPU laptop... which turned up the fact that I would have basically been running stable diffusion on CPU&quot; due to lack of ROCm support.</span><span class="c16">14</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This indicates that AMD&#39;s historical neglect of the entry-level and consumer market for ROCm support has created a significant barrier to adoption and fostered a perception of difficulty among potential users.</span><span class="c7">17</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7"></span></p><h2 class="c0"><span class="c24">Cross-Industry Analysis of Recurring Issues</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c24"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">A comprehensive analysis of the case studies and broader community sentiment reveals consistent patterns of challenges across various industries and user types. These recurring issues collectively highlight the areas where AMD&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem, despite recent efforts, continues to lag behind its primary competitor.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Software Maturity Deficiencies</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">ROCm Stability and Bug Reports</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">A pervasive issue reported across different user groups is the general instability and prevalence of bugs within the ROCm software stack. The university cluster&#39;s experience with rocprofilerv3 crashing and its predecessors failing to read counters exemplifies critical tooling failures in a production-bound environment.</span><span class="c16">9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Similarly, users of Stable Diffusion reported &quot;strange hangs&quot; and &quot;intermittent script failure or driver timeout&quot;.</span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Tinygrad, a developer of AI hardware, confirmed &quot;massive issue with AMD software in the past&quot;.</span><span class="c7">8</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">AMD&#39;s own official documentation for ROCm 6.4.1 lists numerous known issues, including &quot;intermittent script failure&quot; for Stable Diffusion, BERT, Llama2, Resnet50, and RetinaNet, as well as &quot;application crash or driver timeout&quot; for ComfyUI and Blender Cycles.</span><span class="c16">29</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This consistent reporting of bugs and stability issues, even acknowledged by AMD itself </span><span class="c16">2</span><span class="c5">, suggests a significant accumulation of technical debt within the ROCm software stack. This manifests as a fragile developer experience, where basic operations or common use cases can lead to unexpected failures or require extensive troubleshooting, directly impacting productivity and trust, especially for production environments. The analysis by SemiAnalysis directly attributes this to a &quot;weaker-than-expected software Quality Assurance (QA) culture and its challenging out-of-the-box experience&quot; at AMD.</span><span class="c7">8</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c7"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Lack of Comprehensive Feature Support and Optimization</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Critical AI optimizations, particularly for modern LLM and generative AI workloads, often exhibit performance deficiencies or require complex workarounds on AMD GPUs. The llama.cpp user&#39;s experience with Flash Attention on the RX 7900 XTX highlights this: a critical performance-enhancing technique showed significant degradation due to the poor performance of its HIP port from CUDA.</span><span class="c16">12</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This is not merely a missing feature but a case where the implemented feature performs sub-optimally. Stable Diffusion users also frequently complained about the lack of Flash Attention support, often requiring manual compilation or reliance on unofficial branches.</span><span class="c7">13</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">While AMD is actively working to implement and optimize features like BF16 and FP8 support, and improve Flash Attention </span><span class="c16">1</span><span class="c5">, the delay in bringing these critical components to full performance parity directly impacts the competitiveness and usability of AMD GPUs. The necessity for manual compilation or reliance on &quot;third-party patches&quot; </span><span class="c16">11</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;creates a significant barrier to entry and adoption. This situation illustrates that simply achieving feature parity is insufficient; the performance of these features on ROCm must also be competitive and seamlessly integrated to provide a truly viable alternative to NVIDIA&#39;s established ecosystem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Challenges with Consumer-Grade GPU Support and Windows Compatibility</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">A recurring theme is the fragmented and often insufficient ROCm support for AMD&#39;s consumer-grade Radeon GPUs. Official support is frequently limited to specific high-end series, such as the RX 7900 series.</span><span class="c16">11</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Users attempting to leverage other consumer cards (e.g., RX 6800, RX 580, Radeon 890M integrated GPUs) for AI/ML tasks encounter severe compatibility issues, often resulting in workloads effectively running on the CPU or demanding extensive workarounds.</span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The Framework Laptop user&#39;s experience vividly demonstrates this disconnect, where a new &quot;AI series&quot; laptop&#39;s integrated GPU lacked ROCm support, forcing reliance on unofficial patches.</span><span class="c7">11</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Furthermore, Windows support for ROCm has been &quot;sorely lacking&quot; and even &quot;on hold&quot; for popular applications like Fooocus/Stable Diffusion, with DirectML offering significantly slower performance.</span><span class="c16">13</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;While AMD has recently pledged broader ROCm support for Windows and Radeon GPUs in the second half of 2025 </span><span class="c16">23</span><span class="c5">, this historical deficiency has alienated a large segment of the developer community who primarily operate in a Windows environment. Moreover, AMD explicitly states that its Radeon PRO Series cards are &quot;not designed nor recommended for datacenter usage&quot; </span><span class="c16">29</span><span class="c4">, which is a significant limitation for enterprises seeking to repurpose or scale professional workstation cards.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">This fragmented support creates a significant barrier to &quot;grassroots&quot; adoption. NVIDIA&#39;s dominance was partly built on widespread consumer GPU adoption for early AI/ML experimentation, which then scaled to enterprise. AMD&#39;s historical neglect of consumer-grade ROCm support and ongoing Windows compatibility issues create a significant hurdle for individual developers and small teams to easily experiment and build on AMD hardware. This, in turn, limits the talent pool familiar with ROCm, perpetuating the ecosystem gap and making it harder for enterprises to find skilled AMD AI engineers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Reliability Concerns</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Beyond functional correctness, the reliability of AMD&#39;s GPU drivers and software stack presents a significant challenge. Users frequently report &quot;horrible VRAM usage spikes&quot; </span><span class="c16">17</span><span class="c5">, &quot;strange hangs&quot; </span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">, and &quot;weird system hangs&quot; that can lead to overall system instability.</span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Official AMD documentation lists &quot;intermittent application crash or driver timeout&quot; for various workloads, including ComfyUI with WSL2 on RX 7900 Series and Blender Cycles rendering.</span><span class="c16">29</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;At a lower level, developers have noted that AMD GPUs can &quot;hang&quot; due to &quot;bad memory access&quot; up to the Navi 3x architecture, a problem less common with NVIDIA cards.</span><span class="c7">30</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">These reliability issues are more than mere performance bottlenecks; they directly impact the ability to complete AI/ML jobs consistently and predictably. For production environments, such instability is unacceptable and leads to significant operational overhead. The consistent presence of reliability problems erodes developer and enterprise trust. If a system frequently crashes or hangs, the cost of debugging, re-running jobs, and lost productivity quickly outweighs any potential hardware cost savings. This creates a perception of unreliability that is difficult to overcome, even with improvements in raw performance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Ecosystem Gaps</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">The breadth and maturity of the software ecosystem surrounding AMD GPUs remain a critical area of deficiency, especially when compared to NVIDIA&#39;s CUDA.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Limited Third-Party Library and Framework Integration</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">While AMD claims &quot;Support for Leading Frameworks&quot; like PyTorch and TensorFlow </span><span class="c16">27</span><span class="c5">, and highlights partnerships with major players like Hugging Face, vLLM, and SGLang </span><span class="c16">23</span><span class="c5">, real-world user experiences often present a different picture. Developers frequently state that &quot;everything is standardized on Nvidia&quot; </span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">, and that many common functionalities &quot;aren&#39;t supported out of the box&quot; on AMD.</span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;The Hugging Face user&#39;s experience with OOM errors and &quot;garbled output&quot; during multi-GPU DDP fine-tuning with the Accelerate library demonstrates that even with stated support, deep optimization and stability for complex scenarios can be lacking.</span><span class="c16">15</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Users also report struggles to run popular third-party ML projects like VLLM, bitsandbytes, and unsloth &quot;without any issues on ALL cards&quot;.</span><span class="c7">17</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">This gap between AMD&#39;s stated framework support and the real-world user experience suggests that while basic compatibility might exist, the level of deep optimization, stability, and feature parity with CUDA-accelerated versions is often insufficient. This forces developers to either wait for AMD or third-party updates, or implement complex workarounds, significantly impeding development velocity. The &quot;CUDA moat&quot; extends beyond just the programming language; it encompasses a vast network of optimized libraries, tools, extensive community support, and pre-trained models built around NVIDIA. While AMD&#39;s efforts to port CUDA applications via HIP are a step, they do not automatically replicate the entire ecosystem&#39;s maturity and seamless integration.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Developer Experience and Tooling</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">The overall developer experience with ROCm is frequently described in highly negative terms, including &quot;pain in the ass&quot; </span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">, &quot;insultingly dreadful&quot; </span><span class="c16">42</span><span class="c5">, and &quot;a clusterfuck to get to work&quot;.</span><span class="c16">30</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Specific tooling limitations contribute to this frustration:</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">roc-profiler is not supported on WSL, and rocm-smi lacks full functionality for active compute processes, GPU utilization, and modifiable state features.</span><span class="c16">29</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Installation and updates are often reported as complex and difficult.</span><span class="c7">10</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">A crucial underlying factor contributing to these issues is AMD&#39;s internal investment in software engineering. SemiAnalysis identified that &quot;AMD&#39;s AI Software Engineering compensation is AMD&#39;s management&#39;s blind spot,&quot; leading to uncompetitive hiring practices compared to NVIDIA and leading AI labs.</span><span class="c16">28</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This suggests a systemic problem within AMD that affects its ability to attract and retain top software engineering talent, which is critical for closing the software gap. The ease of use, quality of tools, and responsiveness of support fundamentally shape developer perception and loyalty. AMD&#39;s historical underinvestment in software development and developer relations has created a significant deficit in this &quot;human factor,&quot; making it an uphill battle to win over a community accustomed to NVIDIA&#39;s mature ecosystem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h4 class="c0"><span class="c8">Access to Hardware for Testing and Development</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Developers have reported that &quot;access to cards is (almost) non existent in the wild&quot; for testing ROCm stacks.</span><span class="c16">17</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;This external challenge is compounded by internal constraints: SemiAnalysis noted that &quot;AMD&#39;s internal teams have little access to GPU boxes to develop and refine the ROCm software stack,&quot; to the extent that TensorWave, an AMD partner, had to provide AMD engineers with free hardware to facilitate software fixes.</span><span class="c7">8</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">This lack of widespread hardware availability, particularly for consumer/prosumer use, limits developer engagement, which in turn slows down ecosystem development and third-party software optimization. This creates a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem: the software will not improve significantly without more users and community contributions, but users are reluctant to adopt without better software. AMD&#39;s internal hardware constraints further exacerbate this cycle, hindering their own ability to rapidly iterate and improve ROCm.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Interconnect and Scalability Limitations</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">While AMD boasts impressive HPC supercomputing deployments like Frontier and El Capitan with ROCm </span><span class="c16">24</span><span class="c5">, general multi-GPU and rack-scale challenges persist in the broader AI/ML context. The Hugging Face user&#39;s experience with OOM errors and &quot;garbled output&quot; when attempting distributed data parallelism with two AMD GPUs highlights issues in multi-GPU communication and memory management for complex AI workloads.</span><span class="c16">15</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Similarly, the</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">llama.cpp user&#39;s observation of significant performance degradation with Flash Attention for higher batch sizes on a single GPU suggests that scaling performance with workload intensity can be problematic.</span><span class="c7">12</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">SemiAnalysis has also pointed to a &quot;Widening Gap Between AMD RCCL and NVIDIA NCCL&quot; (AMD&#39;s communication library equivalent to NVIDIA&#39;s NCCL).</span><span class="c16">28</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Furthermore, AMD&#39;s rack-scale solutions, crucial for large-scale AI training, are not expected until 2026.</span><span class="c16">19</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;A Jefferies analyst suggested that AMD&#39;s UALink interconnect, vital for these solutions, &quot;will likely not be ready for production in 2026,&quot; potentially pushing the &quot;Helios&quot; rack release to 2027.</span><span class="c16">44</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;These delays mean AMD continues to cede ground to NVIDIA in high-demand, large-scale deployments that require robust interconnectivity and seamless multi-GPU scaling. This &quot;scaling tax&quot; imposed by immature multi-GPU software and delayed rack-scale solutions makes large-scale deployments challenging and costly, potentially negating hardware price advantages by increasing engineering effort and time-to-solution.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown of these technical complaints and ecosystem

class="c24"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">The documented challenges with AMD GPUs for AI/ML workloads translate into tangible business impacts for organizations attempting to leverage them. These impacts extend beyond mere technical inconveniences, affecting project timelines, operational costs, team productivity, and ultimately, strategic decisions regarding compute infrastructure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Project Delays and Development Velocity Impact</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Frequent software bugs, driver instability, and the necessity for extensive workarounds directly lead to significant project delays. The university cluster, for instance, explicitly abandoned AMD for a production-bound OpenCL application due to critical profiling tool failures, stating that the project would &quot;not going to happen in time to give the cluster a chance in time to be AMD&quot;.</span><span class="c16">9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Users of Stable Diffusion reported spending &quot;500% more time debugging and erroring&quot; </span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">, and observed that new features often take &quot;3x as long before it works on AMD&quot;.</span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;This directly impedes the rapid iteration and deployment cycles that are crucial in AI/ML development. The pervasive experience of developer friction means that engineering teams are compelled to spend a disproportionate amount of time on infrastructure issues rather than on core AI model development or innovation. This significantly slows down the pace at which new AI capabilities can be brought to market or integrated into existing systems.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Increased Operational Costs Due to Debugging and Workarounds</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">The necessity for manual code modifications, such as &quot;recoding like 8 different files in comfyui&quot; </span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">, reliance on unofficial &quot;third-party patches&quot; </span><span class="c16">11</span><span class="c5">, and extensive troubleshooting </span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;introduces substantial operational overhead. The lack of mature profiling and debugging tools, as highlighted by the non-functional</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">roc-profiler on WSL </span><span class="c16">29</span><span class="c4">, exacerbates these costs by making problem diagnosis and resolution more time-consuming and complex. This directly increases the demand for highly specialized and often expensive AI software engineers whose time is then diverted to managing the AMD stack rather than focusing on value-added AI model development. This misallocation of valuable engineering talent represents a significant opportunity cost; these resources could otherwise be channeled towards innovation, building new AI products, or optimizing existing workflows, directly impacting a company&#39;s competitive edge and long-term strategic positioning.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Decisions to Switch Vendors or Abandon Deployments</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">Perhaps the most severe business impact is the outright abandonment of AMD hardware and a return to, or preference for, NVIDIA solutions. The university cluster&#39;s explicit decision to stick with &quot;NV+CUDA&quot; after encountering critical software failures is a clear example.</span><span class="c16">9</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;Similarly, multiple Stable Diffusion users reported selling their AMD GPUs and switching to NVIDIA cards due to persistent issues.</span><span class="c16">10</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;An individual physicist, after years of trying to make ROCm work, &quot;gave up&quot; and considered purchasing used NVIDIA P40s instead.</span><span class="c16">17</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">llama.cpp user, facing performance degradation, concluded that AMD hardware was not a worthwhile investment compared to second-hand NVIDIA options.</span><span class="c16">12</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;These decisions represent a direct loss of market share for AMD and a reinforcement of NVIDIA&#39;s ecosystem dominance. They are strong indicators that for many users, particularly individual developers and smaller entities, the friction and unreliability of the AMD ecosystem outweigh any perceived hardware benefits, leading to a fundamental lack of trust in AMD&#39;s AI platform for their critical workloads.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><span class="c8">Overall Impact on Competitive Positioning</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c5">The challenges discussed collectively impact AMD&#39;s competitive positioning in the rapidly expanding AI/ML market. While AMD&#39;s hardware, particularly its Instinct series, offers compelling advantages like large memory capacity and competitive price-performance for specific inference workloads (as seen with Microsoft and Meta </span><span class="c16">1</span><span class="c5">), the immaturity of its software stack and ecosystem creates a two-tiered market dynamic. Hyperscalers and large enterprises, possessing vast internal engineering resources, can invest in custom solutions (like Meta&#39;s AITemplate </span><span class="c16">7</span><span class="c4">) or dedicate teams to optimize the AMD stack, thereby unlocking the hardware&#39;s potential despite its native software limitations. For these players, the strategic imperative of vendor diversification and the hardware&#39;s unique attributes (e.g., memory capacity for LLMs) can justify the significant internal effort.</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">However, for the vast majority of the market&mdash;including smaller enterprises, academic institutions, and individual developers&mdash;the &quot;hidden cost&quot; of &quot;cheaper&quot; hardware or a memory advantage quickly becomes prohibitive. The extensive debugging, manual workarounds, and lack of out-of-the-box compatibility translate into higher total cost of ownership (TCO) due to increased developer time and project delays. This creates a significant barrier to widespread adoption and limits AMD&#39;s ability to capture market share beyond a select few highly resourced customers. The consistent negative developer experience also hinders the organic growth of a robust community around ROCm, which is vital for long-term ecosystem health and competitive viability.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4"></span></p><h2 class="c0"><span class="c24">Conclusion: Key Findings and Recommendations for the UnlockGPU Campaign</span></h2><p class="c2"><span class="c24"></span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c4">The analysis of companies and organizations utilizing AMD GPUs for AI/ML workloads reveals a nuanced picture. While AMD&#39;s hardware, particularly its Instinct series, demonstrates strong capabilities and has found adoption among major hyperscalers for large-scale inference, the underlying software maturity, reliability, and ecosystem gaps present significant and recurring challenges across various user segments.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c29">Key Findings:</span></p><ol class="c27 lst-kix_list_2-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Hardware Potential vs. Software Reality:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;AMD&#39;s Instinct GPUs offer competitive performance and significant memory advantages, making them attractive for memory-intensive AI inference workloads, as evidenced by deployments at Meta and Microsoft Azure. However, unlocking this hardware potential often requires substantial internal engineering effort from large enterprises to build custom software layers or extensively optimize the ROCm stack.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Pervasive Software Immaturity:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;The ROCm software stack consistently exhibits issues with stability, bugs, and a lack of comprehensive, performant feature support. Specific problems include critical profiling tool failures, sub-optimal performance of key AI optimizations like Flash Attention, and general instability leading to crashes and hangs. This is attributed, in part, to a historical underinvestment in software quality assurance and internal developer resources at AMD.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Fragmented Ecosystem and Poor Developer Experience:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Support for consumer-grade AMD GPUs is highly inconsistent, and Windows compatibility for ROCm has been severely lacking, alienating a large segment of the developer community. The overall developer experience is frequently described as frustrating, requiring extensive manual workarounds, debugging, and a significant time investment due to limited third-party library integration and inadequate tooling.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Tangible Business Impacts:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;These technical challenges translate directly into project delays, increased operational costs due to the need for extensive debugging and specialized engineering resources, and ultimately, decisions by users and organizations to abandon AMD hardware in favor of NVIDIA&#39;s more mature and reliable ecosystem.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">The Two-Tiered Market:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;A clear distinction emerges between large hyperscalers, who can absorb the overhead of software optimization to leverage AMD&#39;s hardware advantages, and the broader market of smaller enterprises, academic institutions, and individual developers, who face a significantly higher barrier to entry and often find the AMD ecosystem too challenging to navigate effectively.</span></li></ol><p class="c21"><span class="c14 c29">Recommendations for the UnlockGPU Campaign:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4">Based on these findings, the &quot;UnlockGPU campaign&quot; should focus its advocacy and messaging on the following areas to highlight the current deficiencies in AMD&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem:</span></p><ol class="c27 lst-kix_list_3-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c31 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Emphasize the &quot;Hidden Costs&quot; of Adoption:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Beyond raw hardware price, articulate the significant hidden costs associated with AMD GPU adoption, including increased developer time, project delays, and the need for specialized engineering resources to compensate for software immaturity and ecosystem gaps. This directly impacts the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for many organizations.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Highlight Software Reliability and Stability:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Collect and publicize more specific instances of ROCm crashes, driver issues, and unpredictable behavior in production or development environments. The campaign should advocate for greater transparency and accountability from AMD regarding software quality assurance and bug resolution.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Advocate for Comprehensive Consumer and Windows Support:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Stress the importance of robust, out-of-the-box ROCm support for all modern consumer-grade AMD GPUs and a fully-featured, stable Windows environment. This is crucial for fostering grassroots adoption and building a broader developer community, which is foundational for long-term ecosystem growth.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Demand Deeper Ecosystem Integration and Tooling Maturity:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Call for accelerated and deeper integration with popular third-party AI/ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face libraries) that ensures not just compatibility but also performance parity with NVIDIA. The campaign should also push for significant improvements in developer tooling, including reliable profilers, debuggers, and simplified installation processes.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Showcase Abandoned Projects and Vendor Switches:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;Leverage compelling case studies of organizations and individuals who have explicitly abandoned AMD GPUs for AI/ML due to software and ecosystem frustrations. These examples provide concrete evidence of the real-world consequences of AMD&#39;s current challenges.</span></li><li class="c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c14">Contextualize Hyperscaler Adoption:</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;While acknowledging hyperscaler adoption, explain that this often occurs under specific conditions (e.g., memory-bound inference workloads) and is enabled by substantial internal engineering investments that are not feasible for most other organizations. This prevents the narrative of hyperscaler adoption from overshadowing the widespread challenges faced by the broader market.</span></li></ol><p class="c33"><span class="c4">By focusing on these specific, evidence-backed areas, the UnlockGPU campaign can effectively articulate the current limitations of AMD&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem and advocate for the necessary improvements to foster a truly competitive and accessible GPU compute landscape.</span></p><h4 class="c19"><span class="c29 c34">Works cited</span></h4><ol class="c27 lst-kix_list_4-0 start" start="1"><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17">Enhancing AI Training with AMD ROCm Software, accessed June 24, 2025, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/training_rocm_pt/README.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750752257337881&amp;usg=AOvVaw0p9fr5DMYqPFHs90vRVyTM">https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/training_rocm_pt/README.html</a></span></li><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17">AMD Instinct Accelerator and ROCm Software: 2024 Year in Review, accessed June 24, 2025, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/amd-instinct-accelerator-and-rocm-software-2024-year-in-review/ba-p/734477&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750752257338203&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XcTVDVkZYtd_hD81lgAN_">https://community.amd.com/t5/ai/amd-instinct-accelerator-and-rocm-software-2024-year-in-review/ba-p/734477</a></span></li><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17">AMD-Backed TensorWave Raises $100 Million to Deploy Massive AI GPU Cluster, accessed June 24, 2025, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ctol.digital/news/amd-backed-tensorwave-raises-100-million-for-ai-gpu-cluster/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750752257338467&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yVI9OXFQgKljwIlNm6OYs">https://www.ctol.digital/news/amd-backed-tensorwave-raises-100-million-for-ai-gpu-cluster/</a></span></li><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17">New Horizons in AI Infrastructure with AMD Instinct&trade; MI300X GPUs on IBM Cloud, accessed June 24, 2025, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/chris-carter/2025/04/29/amd-instinct-mi300x-ibm-cloud&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1750752257338814&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FSr3j4OLg_lVDuh9D0YmU">https://community.ibm.com/community/user/blogs/chris-carter/2025/04/29/amd-instinct-mi300x-ibm-cloud</a></span></li><li class="c26 li-bullet-0"><span class="c17">AMD MI300X Accelerator Unpacked: Specs, Performance, &amp; More -

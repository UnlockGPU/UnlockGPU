**Research Objective:** Generate a comprehensive background report on developer
*and user sentiment toward AMD GPU software ecosystem, focusing on barriers to
*adoption and opportunities for improvement.

**Scope & Timeline:** 
- Primary focus: 2022-2025 (recent experiences and current pain points) -
Secondary: Historical context from 2018-2021 for trend analysis - Include both
individual developers and enterprise/institutional perspectives

**Key Software Areas to Investigate:**
1. **ROCm Platform** - Installation, compatibility, stability, performance vs
CUDA 2. **GPU Drivers** - Linux and Windows stability, gaming vs compute
workloads 3. **Development Tools** - Debuggers, profilers, IDEs, documentation
quality 4. **CUDA Compatibility** - HIP, translation tools, migration
experiences 5. **AI/ML Frameworks** - PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face
integration 6. **Consumer GPU Support** - RX 6000/7000 series software support
gaps

**Sources to Search:**
- **Developer Forums:** Stack Overflow, AMD Developer Community, GitHub issues -
**Social Platforms:** Reddit (r/AMD, r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA,
r/gamedev), Hacker News, Twitter/X - **Professional Networks:** LinkedIn
developer groups, Discord servers (AMD, AI/ML communities) - **Specialized
Communities:** ROCm GitHub discussions, OpenCL forums, Phoronix comments -
**Academic/Research:** University HPC forums, research computing mailing lists

**Specific Pain Points to Document:**
- Installation and setup difficulties ("It just doesn't work" stories) -
Performance comparisons with NVIDIA alternatives - Compatibility issues with
popular frameworks - Documentation gaps and quality issues - Consumer GPU
support limitations - Driver stability problems - Migration challenges from CUDA

**Analysis Framework:**
1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Categorize opinions as Positive/Neutral/Negative with
reasoning 2. **Pain Point Frequency:** Rank most commonly mentioned issues 3.
**Solution Suggestions:** Collect developer-proposed fixes and improvements 4.
**Success Stories:** Document cases where AMD software worked well 5. **Trend
Analysis:** Compare recent vs. historical sentiment 6. **Demographic Insights:**
Academic vs. industry vs. hobbyist perspectives

**Output Structure:**
- Executive Summary (key findings, overall sentiment trend) - Detailed Pain
Points Analysis (with specific examples and quotes) - Developer Solution
Recommendations (community-suggested improvements) - Competitive Analysis
(direct NVIDIA/CUDA comparisons) - Market Opportunity Assessment (unmet needs,
potential wins) - Appendix: Raw data, sources, methodology

**Special Focus Areas:**
- Grassroots developer adoption barriers (aligns with campaign's emphasis on
accessible hardware) - Enterprise adoption blockers - Open source project
maintainer experiences - Impact on smaller developers vs. large organizations -
Regional differences in adoption and sentiment

**Quality Criteria:**
- Prioritize recent, detailed technical feedback over generic complaints -
Include both positive and negative perspectives for balance - Focus on
actionable, specific issues rather than vague criticisms - Verify claims where
possible with technical documentation - Distinguish between hardware and
software-related issues

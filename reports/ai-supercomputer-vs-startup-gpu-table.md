# Supercomputers vs. AI Startups: GPU/Compute Provider Table (2025)

**Executive Summary:**

This report compares the primary compute hardware used by the world's top 20 supercomputers (June 2025 TOP500) and a representative list of 20 leading AI startups (2025). While AMD powers 13 of the top 20 supercomputers, 19 of the top 20 AI startups rely on NVIDIA GPUs via cloud or direct hardware, with only one (Cerebras) using its own proprietary silicon. This highlights a stark gap between AMD's presence in scientific computing and its near-total absence in the commercial AI startup ecosystem.

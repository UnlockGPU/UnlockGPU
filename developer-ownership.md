# What If Developers Owned the Platform?

## The Campaign Works Without This—But Could Become So Much More

UnlockGPU is a tactical campaign to file a shareholder resolution at AMD.  
It doesn't require a mass movement—just one shareholder with $2,000 in stock for one year.  
We already qualify. The resolution will happen.

But if this campaign grows, something bigger becomes possible:  
**a new kind of organization—part activist fund, part engineering guild, part cooperative.**

## This Is Not a Petition. It's the Seed of an Institution.

Online petitions ask nicely.  
Shareholder resolutions compel a formal response, trigger press coverage, and show up in proxy materials sent to every investor.

But filing one resolution is only the beginning.  
If hundreds of developers buy AMD stock and coordinate, we move from "lone activist" to **governance bloc**.

- We set public technical expectations.
- We back them with financial ownership.
- We vote, organize, and pressure—legally and publicly.

This isn't a nonprofit. It's not a startup.  
It's not exactly a foundation either.

## How It Compares: A Cooperative, But Inverted

Cooperatives are owned by their workers or users. They operate democratically, aligning ownership with the people who depend on or contribute to the system.

The **UnlockGPU movement shares that spirit**—but flips the structure:

| Traditional Cooperative            | UnlockGPU Model                           |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Users or workers own the business | Developers buy into an existing company   |
| One-member-one-vote governance     | Voting shares in a public corporation     |
| Private or internal coordination   | Public GitHub-based documents and forums  |
| Internal revenue distribution      | External pressure to reshape public value |

This is **a public-company-scale cooperative overlay**:  
- Our "equity" comes from buying stock, not being hired.  
- Our "board proposals" are real shareholder resolutions.  
- Our "roadmap" is maintained as open Markdown and community pull requests.

We're not waiting for the company to become ours.  
We **inject ourselves into its governance** using the rights available to any shareholder.

This is asymmetric, lightweight, and composable—just like the open-source tools we build.

## Why Developers + Ownership = Leverage

Open source has always had outsized impact—but little structural power.  
Meanwhile, shareholder activism has structural power—but rarely technical depth.

**Combining the two creates something new:**

- Developers bring legitimacy, specificity, and trust.
- Shareholding adds legal standing, visibility, and pressure.
- Together, it becomes a hybrid movement with both *moral authority* and *governance force*.

This isn't theory. This is SEC rule 14a-8. This is Engine No. 1 at Exxon.  
But now with GitHub issues, not oil analysts.

## The User Innovation Advantage: Why Developers Know What to Build

**The traditional model is backwards.**  
AMD's engineers guess what developers need, then developers struggle with what AMD built.

But research from Eric von Hippel shows that **users are often the primary source of innovation**—not manufacturers. In software tooling especially, the people closest to the problems develop the best solutions. ([*Democratizing Innovation*](https://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/democ1.htm), MIT Press)

**Developers have "sticky information" AMD can't easily access:**
- Which workflows actually break in production
- What missing features block real projects  
- How installation failures cascade through different environments
- Which performance bottlenecks matter most for emerging use cases

**AMD has the engineering resources, but developers have the innovation insights.**

This isn't just theory—it's already happening:
- Community patches fix ROCm issues faster than official releases
- Third-party tools like "Radeon Software Slimmer" solve problems AMD ignores
- Developer workarounds become the de facto standard before official support arrives

**The UnlockGPU model systematically captures this user innovation:**
- Developer Advisory Board channels technical insights directly into roadmap decisions
- Shareholder governance ensures those insights can't be ignored or deprioritized  
- Community-maintained priority documents evolve faster than internal product management

We're not asking AMD to listen to users.  
We're asking AMD to **systematically harness user innovation** through ownership structure.

## You Don't Need to Believe in the Vision to Act Now

Let's be clear:  
You don't have to buy stock. You don't have to build a new institution.

All you need to do today is help push AMD to fix its broken software stack.  
That alone unlocks massive value for developers, for AMD, and for the GPU ecosystem.

But if we succeed—if this campaign gains momentum—**we might discover we've built something new.**

## Conclusion: An Open, Shareholder-Aligned Compute Cooperative

We're not calling for a revolution.  
We're calling for transparency, reliability, and public accountability—driven by those who actually use the platform.

If enough developers own shares, contribute priorities, and vote as a bloc, we can:

- Push AMD to prioritize drivers, docs, and open standards  
- Reward real progress, not just marketing promises  
- Create a governance structure rooted in both technical excellence and public accountability  

This isn't a dream. It's a forkable, executable strategy.

**Own where you code. Vote where you build. Let's make the GPU stack work—for real.**

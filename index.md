**Unlock the GPU: A developer–investor alliance, can force AMD to fix its software and break Nvidia's monopoly.**

# This campaig is now suspended indefinitely

I have read about the AMD software problems for years. I believed that it will be overcome one day
and I invested a bit. Then one day I read both another Hacker News discussion on AMD and the excellent Money Stuff newsletter by Matt Levine
and ... I connected the dots.

I started writing this manifesto (in many versions - some of them are in this repo) and other articles.
And it was too easy to dismiss the latest AMD management declarations about turning over and becoming
software first as corporate propaganda.
But I prepared lots of reports using Google DeepSearch and OpenAI DeepResearch
I learned a lot about both shareholder activism and about the way big companies are governed
and also the history of AMD software credibility problems.
And when I dug deeply into latest AMD actions I started to think that maybe this time it is different.
Sometimes this might happen I guess.

After reading the latest report I generated with the help of Google's Deep Search:
[*AMD's Software Credibility Crisis: An Adequacy Analysis of the ROCm Counter-Offensive](reports/gemini/AMDs_Software_Crisis_Analysis.pdf)
[result of [this prompt](reports/amd_response_to_cred_crisis.prompt)]
I was convinced.

It even reports that [Lisa Su talked to George Hotz](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Lisa-Su-ROCm-Commitment) 
and he commented that "things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public."

It is far from obvious that this will indeed be the turn around for AMD and there are still some things that might
make one skeptic - like the continuing buy backs - when it is clear that the company should invest that money into sofware.
One day I might get back to this campaign idea - but now I don't have much more fuel for continuing.
It seems that they do started doing the right thing.

I am betting on this company.

**Unlock the GPU: A developer–investor alliance, can force AMD to fix its software and break Nvidia's monopoly.**

# This campaig is now suspended indefinitely

I have read about the AMD software problems for years. I believed that it will be overcome one day
and I invested a bit. Then one day I read both another Hacker News discussion on AMD and the excellent Money Stuff newsletter by Matt Levine
and ... I connected the dots.

I started writing this manifesto (in many versions - some of them are in this repo) and other articles.
I prepared lots of reports using Google DeepSearch and OpenAI DeepResearch
I learned a lot about both the theory of shareholder resolutions and about the way big companies are governed
and the history of AMD software credibility problems.
Then when I dug deeply into latest AMD actions I started to think that maybe this time it is different.
Sometimes this might happen I guess.

After reading the latest report I generated with the help of Google's Deep Search:
[*AMD's Software Credibility Crisis: An Adequacy Analysis of the ROCm Counter-Offensive](reports/gemini/AMDs_Software_Crisis_Analysis.pdf)
[result of [this prompt](reports/amd_response_to_cred_crisis.prompt)]
I was convinced.

It even reports that [Lisa Su talked to George Hotz](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Lisa-Su-ROCm-Commitment) 
and he commented that "things will get better and AMD will begin to develop in public."

It is far from obvious that this will indeed be the turn around for AMD and one day I might
get back to this idea - but George Hotz rants were the biggest motivation for this campaign
- now I don't have much more fuel for continuing.  It seems that they do started doing the right thing.

I am betting on this company.

**Unlock the GPU: A developer–investor alliance, can force AMD to fix its software and break Nvidia's monopoly.**

Why settle for another petition when you can put your demands directly on the Board's agenda? This is the first campaign where developers become investors—uniting with existing shareholders to act as owners and demand real change at the boardroom level.

## Why hasn't AMD broken the CUDA monopoly?

Industry benchmarks show that AMD has the hardware to compete, with the MI300X showing to be [absolutely competitive with Nvidia's H100 GPU on one set of AI inference benchmarks](https://semianalysis.com/2025/05/23/amd-vs-nvidia-inference-benchmark-who-wins-performance-cost-per-million-tokens/). However, years of broken promises and unreliable software have left developers skeptical and investors cautious.

## The Real Obstacle: Credibility Crisis

If you've ever tried to use AMD for AI, you know the pain: missing features, unstable drivers, or unsupported hardware. ROCm has become known as ["the Dark Souls of machine learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/)—technically possible, but brutally difficult. Or, as another developer bluntly put it:

> "It's just all a pain to use." — on the AMD software stack [[source]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43547461)

This reputation, echoed across forums and technical discussions, keeps many developers from even trying AMD for new AI projects. More examples and technical details are documented in the [Developer Priorities Document](/priorities/).

Without credible, public, and sustained action, developers won't invest their time, contribute code, or build on AMD's platform. This credibility gap is the true bottleneck to AMD's success in AI and high-performance computing.

## Our Unique Approach: Shareholder Activism for Open Source

This isn't a petition. It's a resolution—real power, real leverage. Unlike typical open source advocacy, our campaign uses investor rights to require AMD's Board to address credibility and accountability at the highest level.

This approach works. In 2021, Engine No. 1—a small activist fund—won board seats at ExxonMobil with just 0.02% of shares, forcing real change by rallying other investors. Investor power can move even the biggest companies. We can do the same for open GPU software.

This mechanism creates real, public pressure for change that cannot be ignored or spun. It is a strategic tool to ensure AMD's commitments are credible, public, and sustained.

## Our Demands

To restore trust and unlock AMD's potential, we call on AMD to:

- Make credible, public, and ongoing commitments to open-source software development and support, such as publishing detailed roadmaps and progress reports.
- Establish transparent processes for engaging and incorporating input from developers and researchers, for example through a Developer Advisory Board or regular open forums.
- Implement Board-level oversight and transparent reporting, including tracking and disclosing key metrics on software compatibility, installation success, and user satisfaction.
- Provide clear and public support timelines for a broad range of GPUs, including consumer and academic hardware.

These demands are designed to be compatible with what is possible in a shareholder resolution under SEC rules: they focus on credibility, transparency, engagement, and accountability, not prescriptive technical or budgetary details.

## The Payoff: Breaking the CUDA Monopoly

If AMD restores trust and delivers on open GPU software, it can break NVIDIA's monopoly. This will unlock billions in value, end vendor lock-in, and support open innovation in AI and science. The upside is enormous—not just for AMD shareholders, but for the entire technology ecosystem.

- [Nvidia Makes Nearly 1,000% Profit](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-makes-1000-profit-on-h100-gpus-report) on some cards—the "NVIDIA tax"—because it can.
- AMD powers 34% of Top500 supercomputers, but consumer adoption is stalled by software failures.
- The market does not yet price in what happens when AMD fixes the software bottleneck.

## Q: Are you trolling AMD?

**A:**

We use some tactics that resemble trolling—but we actually want to help AMD regain their credibility in the dev community. We do it by putting demands on AMD, just like rating agencies demand stuff from companies to help them sell their bonds.

## About the Campaign

<a id="vs-petitions"></a>
## Q: How is this different from online petitions?

**A:**

Online petitions = begging politely with zero consequences.

Shareholder activism = legal obligations, SEC oversight, and mandatory board attention.

Petitions get ignored. Shareholder resolutions get included in proxy statements sent to every AMD investor, force public responses, and create ongoing leverage.

We're not asking nicely—we're using corporate governance to create real pressure.

<a id="who-behind"></a>
## Q: Who is behind this campaign?

**A:**

To be honest so far it is just me - Zbigniew Łukasiak, see [my AI related blog](https://zzbbyy.substack.com/), 
plus a friend who holds AMD shares for over a year and who promised do file the shareholder resolution (I hold them too but not long enough).

I am looking for allies.

<a id="how-started"></a>
## Q: How did you start this project?

**A:**

I was reading George Hotz rants on AMD and Matt Levine's "Money Stuff Newsletter" around the same time. And I thought: shareholder activism in AMD? Why not—totally doable.

## Strategy & Approach

<a id="actual-force"></a>
## Q: What actual force do you have over AMD? How can a few people change a billion-dollar company?

**A:**

The barrier is shockingly low: just $2,000 of AMD stock for three years gets you shareholder resolution powers. We already qualify.

Engine No. 1 took down ExxonMobil's board with 0.02% ownership. We don't need to own AMD—we just need to be right and loud about it.

Even "losing" votes of 10-20% create massive pressure because they signal serious problems that can't be ignored anymore.

For detailed strategy, see [Shareholder Activism: How You Can Force Real Change]({{ site.baseurl }}/activism/).

<a id="why-amd"></a>

## Q: Why not target NVIDIA directly? Isn't NVIDIA the real problem?

**A:**

NVIDIA's monopoly is the problem, but they only respond to real competition, not angry tweets.

AMD is the only company that can actually challenge NVIDIA. But their current "openness" is just marketing—tools that don't work aren't actually open.

NVIDIA's monopoly breaks when AMD stops sucking. We're here to make sure that happens.

When AMD wins, the "CUDA tax" disappears and everyone wins. Except NVIDIA's shareholders.

<a id="amd-knows"></a>
## Q: Doesn't AMD already know all of this?

**A:**

Of course they do. AMD talks about beating NVIDIA in every earnings call.

But knowing ≠ doing. They've known about these problems for years—progress has been pathetic.

We're not here to educate AMD. We're here to create the pressure that turns promises into actual progress.

Think credit rating agencies: companies know how to manage debt, but external oversight is what makes it happen.

<a id="why-shareholder-activism"></a>
## Q: Why shareholder activism instead of working with AMD directly?

**A:**

Developer forums don't work. GitHub issues get ignored. Polite feedback disappears into the corporate void.

Shareholder resolutions create legal obligations and force board-level attention that can't be delegated away.

It's "trust but verify" for corporate commitments. Time to try something that actually works.

<a id="if-ignored"></a>
## Q: What happens if AMD ignores the shareholder resolution?

**A:**

They can't ignore it—it gets included in proxy materials sent to every shareholder, and they must provide an official response.

Even if we "lose," 10-20% votes signal serious problems that force management action.

Most successful campaigns don't win on the first try—they build pressure over time. We can file annually until they fix what's broken.

## Technical Context

<a id="technical-problems"></a>
## Q: What specific technical problems need to be fixed?

**A:**

The usual suspects: drivers crash, installations break, Windows support is trash, documentation sucks, and half the libraries don't work.

ROCm only supports "blessed" GPUs while dropping consumer cards that people actually own.

Years of broken promises have destroyed developer trust.

For the full list, see our [Developer Priorities Document]({{ site.baseurl }}/priorities/).

<a id="rocm-vs-cuda"></a>
## Q: How is AMD's ROCm different from CUDA?

**A:**

**CUDA:** Proprietary, NVIDIA-only, but it actually works.

**ROCm:** Open source, vendor-neutral, but doesn't work reliably.

AMD's hardware is competitive. The software ecosystem is trash.

NVIDIA charges a monopoly tax because they can. ROCm could break that—if it actually worked.

<a id="success-metrics"></a>
## Q: What would success look like from a developer perspective?

**A:**

ROCm that actually works. Drivers that don't crash. Windows support that exists.

Basically: AMD becoming a real alternative to NVIDIA instead of just talking about it.

Success = developers choosing GPUs based on merit, not vendor lock-in.

## Participation & Getting Involved

<a id="how-to-help"></a>
## Q: How can I help if I'm not a developer or investor?

**A:**

Share the campaign (#UnlockGPU), tell your stories about GPU vendor lock-in, and connect us with relevant people.

Buy some AMD stock if you can—even small amounts help.

Every voice matters. Broad support is what makes campaigns work.

<a id="need-stock"></a>
## Q: Do I need to buy AMD stock to participate?

**A:**

Nope. You can help by spreading awareness, providing feedback, and building community.

But owning stock does give you voting power and skin in the game.

Even small amounts help—this campaign's strength comes from broad participation, not big wallets.

<a id="timeline"></a>
## Q: What's the timeline for this campaign?

**A:**

To be formulated.

**Key milestone:** AMD's annual shareholder meeting in May 2026 will be the focal point for formal resolutions, but campaign activities happen year-round.

<a id="tracking-progress"></a>
## Q: How will I know if this campaign is making progress?

**A:**

To be formulated.

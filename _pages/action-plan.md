# UnlockGPU Campaign Action Plan

*This is a working document that evolves continuously based on community feedback and campaign developments.*

Our campaign operates on multiple fronts, targeting different communities and stakeholders to build momentum for AMD software accountability. Here's our comprehensive strategy from minimum viable impact to transformational change.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Now - September 2025)

### Core Campaign Activities

**ðŸŽ¯ Open Source Community Outreach**
- Engage ML/AI frameworks communities (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX)
- Target HPC and scientific computing communities 
- Reach out to Linux distributions and GPU driver maintainers
- Connect with open source advocacy organizations

**ðŸ“ˆ AMD Shareholder Engagement**
- Identify and connect with existing institutional AMD shareholders
- Reach out to ESG-focused investment funds interested in open standards
- Engage retail investor communities (Reddit, Discord, investing forums)
- Connect with tech-savvy angel investors and VCs

**ðŸ’» AMD User Communities**
- Document pain points in developer forums (Stack Overflow, GitHub, Reddit)
- Engage gaming communities frustrated with AMD driver issues
- Connect with researchers blocked by ROCm limitations
- Build case studies from enterprise users facing vendor lock-in

**ðŸ“Š Evidence Gathering**
- Collect technical documentation of AMD software failures
- Survey developers about their AMD experiences
- Document competitive analysis vs NVIDIA ecosystem
- Build financial case for why this matters to shareholders

## Phase 2: Resolution Filing (October - November 2025)

### Minimum Viable Plan

**Our baseline commitment:** Even with minimal support, we will execute this core plan:

âœ… **File the Shareholder Resolution**
- Meet SEC Rule 14a-8 requirements and AMD's November 28, 2025 deadline
- Submit a compelling 500-word resolution demanding software accountability
- Ensure proper legal compliance and delivery tracking

âœ… **Generate Media Attention**
- Coordinate press release with resolution filing
- Pitch tech journalists and financial media
- Leverage social media and developer communities
- Frame as "developers-turned-investors demanding change"

âœ… **Vote Mobilization**
- Create easy voting guides for all AMD shareholders
- Target retail investors through online communities
- Provide simple instructions for proxy voting

**Expected Impact:** Even modest support (5-15% of votes) creates public pressure and validates developer concerns, making it harder for AMD to ignore software issues.

## Phase 3: Escalation (December 2025 - May 2026)

### Support-Dependent Strategy

**If we achieve moderate support (15-30% shareholder backing):**

ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Pressure Campaign**
- Coordinate with institutional investors for joint statements
- Organize developer boycotts or public commitments to avoid AMD until fixes
- Launch sustained media campaign highlighting AMD's credibility crisis
- Engage analyst community to factor software risk into AMD valuations

**If we achieve strong support (30%+ shareholder backing):**

ðŸš€ **Board-Level Change Strategy**
- Consider nominating developer-friendly board candidates for 2027
- Partner with established activist investors for director nominations
- Launch comprehensive governance reform campaign
- Push for dedicated Chief Technology Officer or Developer Relations executive

## Phase 4: Follow-Through (Post-2026 Meeting)

### Accountability and Persistence

**Regardless of vote outcome:**
- Monitor and document AMD's response to developer concerns
- Continue annual shareholder proposals until meaningful change occurs
- Build permanent advocacy organization for open GPU software
- Share our model with other communities facing similar corporate accountability issues

**If successful:**
- Work with AMD on implementation of approved measures
- Help establish promised developer advisory boards or feedback mechanisms
- Continue monitoring to ensure commitments are kept

## Community-Specific Strategies

### Developer Communities
- **GitHub:** Star repos, contribute to issues documenting AMD problems
- **Reddit:** r/MachineLearning, r/AMD, r/LocalLLaMA engagement
- **Discord/Slack:** Join ML/AI community servers, share experiences
- **Conferences:** Present at PyData, OSCON, Linux conferences

### Investment Communities  
- **Reddit:** r/investing, r/SecurityAnalysis, r/stocks
- **Twitter/X:** FinTech and tech investor hashtags
- **LinkedIn:** Professional investor networks
- **Institutional:** Direct outreach to ESG and tech-focused funds

### Technical Communities
- **Stack Overflow:** Answer questions highlighting AMD software limitations
- **Hacker News:** Strategic posting and commenting
- **Academic:** Reach out through university CS departments
- **Enterprise:** Connect through professional networks

## Success Metrics

### Immediate Goals (by Resolution Filing)
- [ ] 1,000+ developers pledged to vote AMD shares
- [ ] 10+ institutional investors expressing support  
- [ ] Major tech media coverage of the campaign
- [ ] $1M+ in AMD shares committed to voting with us

### Medium-term Goals (by 2026 Meeting)
- [ ] 15%+ shareholder vote in favor of resolution
- [ ] AMD public commitment to developer advisory board
- [ ] Sustained tech media coverage of AMD software issues
- [ ] Other GPU companies proactively addressing similar concerns

### Long-term Goals (2-3 years)
- [ ] Measurable improvement in AMD software reliability
- [ ] Increased developer adoption of AMD GPUs for AI/ML
- [ ] Reduced "NVIDIA tax" due to meaningful competition
- [ ] Our model replicated for other corporate accountability campaigns

## How This Scales

**Minimum Resources:** Even with just our core team, we can file the resolution and generate initial media attention.

**Moderate Resources:** With community support, we can run sustained pressure campaigns and build lasting accountability mechanisms.

**Maximum Resources:** With significant investor backing, we can pursue board-level changes and fundamental governance reforms.

The beauty of this approach is that each level of support unlocks additional strategic options while still delivering value at the minimum viable level.

# Why Forward-Looking Companies Should Support the UnlockGPU Campaign

*UnlockGPU is not about interfering in AMD's business. It's about fixing a broken part of the ecosystem that affects all of us. Companies who care about the future of AI, open infrastructure, and developer autonomy have every reason to get involved.*

## The Problem: A Chokepoint in the Compute Stack

NVIDIA's dominance in GPU softwareâ€”through CUDAâ€”creates a bottleneck for innovation. It:

* Locks the entire AI ecosystem into one vendor
* Drives up costs ("NVIDIA tax")
* Forces everyone to adapt to a closed, proprietary stack

AMD has competitive hardware and claims open-source values. But after years of underinvestment in software, developers don't trust them. The ROCm stack has earned the community nickname ["the Dark Souls of machine learning"](https://linustechtips.com/topic/1603733-rocm-is-the-dark-souls-of-machine-learning/)â€”technically possible but brutally difficult. Everyone wants an alternativeâ€”but no one believes it's ready.

## The Business Risk: Production AI on Broken Software

This isn't just about developer preferenceâ€”it's about business continuity:

* **25% of AI models fail accuracy tests** on AMD hardware, making production deployment risky
* **Critical features missing**: Flash Attention 2, vLLM FP8 quantization non-functional on consumer GPUs
* **Installation failures** block development teams from even evaluating AMD alternatives
* **Driver instability** causes system crashes and productivity losses

**The market impact:** AMD powers 34% of Top500 supercomputers but struggles with grassroots developer adoptionâ€”creating a dangerous ecosystem inversion where enterprise leads but innovation suffers.

## Why Companies Should Care

### This Is a Shared Strategic Interest

If you work in:

* **Cloud infrastructure** (e.g. AWS, Azure, Oracle)
* **AI model development** (e.g. Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic)
* **Open-source frameworks** (e.g. PyTorch, JAX, Triton, Hugging Face)
* **Enterprise tooling or platforms** (e.g. data science, CAD, medical imaging)

Then you already rely on GPU computeâ€”and probably wish you had more options.

Support for AMD software maturity is **not charity**. It's an investment in reducing risk, lowering cost, and unlocking long-term optionality.

### It's Not Interferenceâ€”It's Ecosystem Participation

* Companies already buy shares in their suppliers, partners, or strategic tech dependencies
* This is not about micromanaging AMDâ€”it's about ensuring *someone* is holding them accountable to the developer community

Our campaign doesn't demand control. It demands:

* A real software budget ($200M/year ring-fenced for GPU software)
* Long-term consumer GPU support (5-year lifecycles, RDNA4 inclusion)  
* Transparent roadmaps and developer input (binding quarterly progress reports)

This helps *everyone* who wants a second source of high-performance compute.

## Why It Makes Business Sense

| Goal                             | How UnlockGPU Helps                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Break vendor lock-in**         | Pushes AMD to become a viable CUDA alternative        |
| **Lower AI infra costs**         | Enables price pressure on NVIDIA                      |
| **Secure long-term supply**      | Reduces single-vendor risk in GPU stack               |
| **Align with open standards**    | Advocates for SYCL, OpenXLA, and community governance |
| **Recruit open-source goodwill** | Positions you as a champion of developer needs        |

> ðŸ’¬ **Meta** is already deploying AMD Instinct for LLaMA workloads but faces software ecosystem gaps.
> ðŸ’¬ **Microsoft** has invested in OpenXLA and Tritonâ€”direct beneficiaries of better ROCm support.
> ðŸ’¬ **Hugging Face** and **PyTorch** would benefit directly from fixing the 25% model failure rate.

You don't need to take over the campaign. But you do have a stake in whether it succeeds.

## Ways to Support (Quiet or Loud)

| Action                                                    | Public?           | Impact                   | Minimum Investment |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Buy AMD shares and vote on the 2026 resolution            | Private           | Strategic leverage       | - |
| Help file the resolution (if eligible)                    | Optional          | Legitimizes campaign     | SEC eligibility    |
| Endorse open GPU ecosystems publicly                      | Public            | Builds momentum          | None               |
| Offer technical feedback or roadmap suggestions           | Private or public | Improves ROCm stack      | None               |
| Collaborate on open standards and interop (SYCL, OpenXLA) | Public            | Long-term systemic shift | Development time   |

## The Leverage Is Real

Even a **10â€“20% shareholder vote** can trigger internal change at AMD. This isn't a petitionâ€”it's corporate governance. The 2026 shareholder meeting is the moment to act.

You don't need a majority stake. You need conviction, credibility, and coordination. UnlockGPU is organizing thatâ€”and inviting strategic partners who share the goal.

**Historical precedent:** Engine No. 1 changed ExxonMobil's board with just 0.02% ownership by combining technical credibility with strategic activism.

## What You Can Do Now

### Immediate Actions:
* **Contact us** at [team@unlockgpu.com](mailto:team@unlockgpu.com) to coordinate quietly or publicly
* **Buy AMD shares** to gain voting power
* **Review our technical priorities** in the [Developer Priorities Document](https://unlockgpu.com/priorities/)

### Strategic Engagement:
* **Endorse** the principles of open GPU computeâ€”publicly or internally
* **Support dev priorities** through code contributions, bug reports, or roadmap feedback
* **Collaborate** on SYCL, OpenXLA, and other cross-vendor standards

### Timeline Awareness:
* **Q3 2025**: Resolution filing deadline
* **Q1 2026**: AMD annual shareholder meeting

**A healthier GPU ecosystem benefits everyone.**
NVIDIA's moat won't fall because of idealism. But it might fall because the rest of the industry gets organized.

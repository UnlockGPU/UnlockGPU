# üó≥Ô∏è How to Vote Your AMD Shares ‚Äì Main Guide

> This guide covers the standard process for voting your AMD shares at the annual meeting. For broker-specific tips, see the [per-broker voting guide](per-broker-voting.html).

## 1. Determine How You Hold Your Shares

* **Most shareholders hold AMD shares ‚Äúin street name‚Äù via a broker** (Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood, eToro, etc.).
* Others may hold via **Direct Registration (DRS)** or as a **registered shareholder**.
* The process depends on your shareholding type.

## 2. Watch for Proxy Materials

* AMD sends proxy statements and voting instructions weeks before the meeting (typically mid-April for a May meeting).
* **Broker holders:** Your broker or a proxy agent (often Broadridge/ProxyVote.com) will send you a voting code by email, mail, or app notification.
* **Direct/registered holders:** You will get instructions from AMD‚Äôs transfer agent (Computershare).

# Shareholder Activism: How You Can Force Real Change in Public Companies

This campaign harnesses a powerful but often overlooked weapon: **shareholder activism**. Here's exactly how it works, why it's devastatingly effective, and how developers make it unstoppable.

## What Is Shareholder Activism?

Shareholder activism is when investors stop asking nicely and start making demands. You leverage your ownership stake to formally propose changes, force board attention, and create real consequences.

It's corporate democracy in action—and it works.

## Real-World Examples of Impact

**Elliott Management vs. Salesforce (2023):** Elliott forced Salesforce into massive operational reforms through strategic resolutions and relentless pressure. Salesforce had no choice but to comply.

**Engine No. 1 vs. ExxonMobil (2021):** With just 0.02% ownership, they replaced three ExxonMobil board members. Tiny stake, massive impact.

The secret? Be right, be loud, and never back down.

*(Matt Levine's "Money Stuff" newsletter has the full playbook—highly recommended.)*

## A Note on the GameStop Phenomenon

Remember GameStop 2021? Coordinated internet mobilization moved markets and shocked Wall Street.

UnlockGPU channels that same energy—but with technical expertise and legitimate shareholder power instead of meme speculation.

Same collaborative spirit. Better strategy.

## How Shareholder Activism Works

### 1. Filing Shareholder Resolutions

The barrier to entry is shockingly low: just $2,000 of stock held for 3 years gets you resolution power. That's it.

**We already qualify.** For complete details, deadlines, and step-by-step instructions, see our [Resolution Filing Plan](/resolution-filing-plan).

But here's the multiplier: securing a prominent institutional investor to file amplifies everything—credibility, media attention, and management fear.

### 2. Voting on Resolutions

Every shareholder gets a vote. No minimum requirements, no gatekeepers.

- Vote electronically through your broker or [proxyvote.com](https://proxyvote.com)
- Instructions arrive before annual meetings
- Step-by-step voting guide: [How to Vote Your AMD Shares](/guides/voting)

Your vote matters. Use it.

### 3. Coalition Building

Winning campaigns combine multiple forces:

- **Developers** provide technical credibility and define real problems
- **Activist Investors** bring financial firepower and strategic expertise  
- **Media Coverage** amplifies pressure and forces corporate response

Together, we're unstoppable.

## Why We Don't Need a Majority to Win

Here's the secret: you don't need 51% to create change.

Even 10-20% votes signal serious problems that management can't ignore:

- **Reputational damage** that affects stock price and analyst coverage
- **Media attention** that exposes problems publicly
- **Internal validation** for AMD employees who know these issues exist
- **Annual pressure** through repeated resolutions until problems get fixed

Engine No. 1 proved minority shareholders can force transformative change. We're following their playbook.

## Developer Involvement: Our Secret Weapon

Most activist campaigns rely on financial arguments. We have something better: **technical truth**.

Developer involvement makes us unique:

- **Unshakeable credibility** - we know exactly what's broken and how to fix it
- **Media magnet** - technical problems affecting real developers create compelling stories
- **Institutional investor bait** - our technical case attracts serious money and amplifies our power

AMD can dismiss financial activists. They can't dismiss thousands of developers saying their software is broken.

## How You Can Help

**Developers:** Buy shares, contribute technical insights, and vote. Your expertise is our ammunition.

**Investors:** Join the coalition, vote your shares, amplify the message.

**Everyone:** Share the campaign, tell your stories, connect us with allies.

The more voices we have, the harder we are to ignore.

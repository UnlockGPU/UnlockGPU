# UnlockGPU: Developer–Shareholder Alliance
*Using shareholder activism to break the CUDA monopoly and restore AMD's credibility*

Zbigniew Łukasiak, Founder

<!--slide-->

## The Real Problem: Credibility Crisis
- AMD has competitive hardware but **zero developer trust**
- ROCm is "open source" but doesn't work—crashes, broken installs, terrible Windows support
- Without developer credibility, AMD can't challenge NVIDIA's monopoly

<!--slide-->

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail
- **Developer forums:** Issues get ignored or vanish into corporate void
- **Open source advocacy:** Technical insight but zero corporate leverage
- **Polite feedback:** AMD knows what's broken—they've known for years

<!--slide-->

## Our Solution: Shareholder Activism for Open Source
- Use SEC rules to force board-level attention AMD can't ignore
- Create legal obligations and public pressure that turn promises into progress
- **Developer credibility + shareholder rights = real force for change**

<!--slide-->

## What We're Demanding
AMD must restore trust through:
- **Credible commitments** with detailed roadmaps and progress reports
- **Transparent engagement** through developer advisory boards  
- **Board-level oversight** with public metrics on software compatibility
- **Clear support timelines** for broad GPU ranges, including consumer hardware

<!--slide-->

## Why Shareholder Activism Works
- Just $2,000 of AMD stock for 3 years gets you resolution powers—**we qualify**
- Engine No. 1 took down ExxonMobil's board with 0.02% ownership
- Even "losing" votes of 10-20% create massive pressure
- Resolutions get mandatory inclusion in proxy statements sent to every shareholder

<!--slide-->

## Current Status: Small but Real
- **Team:** Solo founder (me) plus a friend with qualifying AMD shares to file the resolution.
- **Looking for allies:** Developers, technical investors, anyone who wants to break the CUDA monopoly.
- **Active campaign:** Public docs, developer priorities, and coalition-building at [UnlockGPU.com](https://unlockgpu.com/).

<!--slide-->

## The Market Opportunity
- AI/compute demand is exploding—the world desperately wants a CUDA alternative.
- AMD's hardware already leads in performance per dollar.
- Breaking NVIDIA's monopoly would unlock billions in value across the entire tech ecosystem.
- Success here creates a repeatable model for other industry bottlenecks.

<!--slide-->

## Timeline & Next Steps
- **2025:** File shareholder resolution, build developer coalition, secure endorsements.
- **May 2026:** AMD's annual shareholder meeting—the focal point for formal resolution vote.
- **Beyond:** Annual pressure until AMD fixes what's broken, then expand the model.

<!--slide-->

## The Ask: Credibility, Not Capital
- **We're not raising money**—just credibility and alignment.
- **Join by buying AMD shares** in the public market (not from us) and pledging your vote.
- **What matters:** Your name, technical reputation, and public support.
- *Your credibility is our leverage. The shares give us the vote.*

<!--slide-->

## Why This Campaign Wins
- **Low barrier to entry:** $2,000 and SEC rules give us real corporate governance power.
- **Asymmetric leverage:** Developer credibility amplified by shareholder rights.
- **Clear value proposition:** When AMD stops sucking, the "CUDA tax" disappears for everyone.
- **Honest about scale:** We're small but growing—and that's exactly how successful campaigns start.

<!--slide-->

## Join the Fight
- Be part of the first developer–shareholder alliance to challenge Big Tech monopolies.
- Help restore open-source credibility in corporate governance.
- **Own where you code. Vote where you build. Break the CUDA monopoly.**

*We're not asking nicely—we're using corporate governance to create real pressure.*

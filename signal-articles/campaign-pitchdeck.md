# UnlockGPU: Developer–Shareholder Alliance
*Using shareholder activism to break the CUDA monopoly and restore AMD's credibility*

Zbigniew Łukasiak, Founder

---

## The Real Problem: Credibility Crisis
- Killer hardware, **zero** developer trust
- "Open source" ROCm crashes, won't install, no Windows
- No trust → no chance against NVIDIA

---

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail
- Forums: posts vanish into the void
- OSS advocates: insight, **no leverage**
- Polite feedback: AMD's heard it for years—still broken

---

## Our Solution: Shareholder Activism<br/>for Open Source
- SEC rules drag dev pain into the boardroom
- Promises → legal obligations + public pressure
- Dev cred × shareholder rights = real force

---

## What We're Demanding
AMD must rebuild trust:
- **Real roadmaps** + public metrics
- **Dev advisory board** with unfiltered updates
- **Board oversight** on compatibility progress
- **Broad GPU support** with clear timelines

---

## Why Shareholder Activism Works
- $2k + 3 yrs of AMD stock = SEC resolution power — we already have it
- Engine No. 1 booted Exxon board with 0.02% shares — size ≠ leverage
- Resolutions land in every proxy packet — can't be ignored
- We're the GPU "credit-rating": fix it or devs won't buy

---

## Current Status: Small but Real
- **Team:** Solo founder (me) plus a friend with qualifying AMD shares to file the resolution.
- **Looking for allies:** Developers, technical investors, anyone who wants to break the CUDA monopoly.
- **Active campaign:** Public docs, developer priorities, and coalition-building at [UnlockGPU.com](https://unlockgpu.com/).

---

## The Market Opportunity
- AI boom begs for a CUDA rival
- AMD hardware already leads $/perf
- Break monopoly → unlock billions across tech
- Playbook repeats for other bottlenecks

---

## Timeline & Next Steps
- **November 2025:** File resolution, grow coalition
- **May 2026:** Shareholder vote showdown
- **After:** Re-file annually until AMD fixes

---

## The Ask: Credibility, Not Capital
- Not raising cash—raising **cred**
- Buy AMD shares **in the open market** (not from us) and pledge your vote
- Your name is leverage; stock is the megaphone

---

## Why This Campaign Wins
- $2k + SEC rules = real power
- Dev credibility × vote leverage = asymmetric edge
- When AMD stops sucking, the CUDA tax dies

---

## Join the Fight
- Be part of the first developer–shareholder alliance to challenge Big Tech monopolies.
- Help restore open-source credibility in corporate governance.
- **Own where you code. Vote where you build. Break the CUDA monopoly.**

*We're not asking nicely—we're using corporate governance to create real pressure.*

# UnlockGPU: Open the GPU
*A developer–investor campaign to break the CUDA monopoly and unleash AMD's value*

Zbigniew Łukasiak, Founder

<!--slide-->

## The Hundreds of Billions Bottleneck
- NVIDIA's CUDA monopoly locks the entire AI/compute industry.
- AMD has competitive hardware—but broken software and trust issues block adoption.
- The result: innovation throttled, "NVIDIA tax" for everyone, hundreds of billions in value wasted or misallocated.

<!--slide-->

## The Market Failure
- AMD's hardware leads in performance/$, but the software stack is fractured and unreliable.
- Developers know what's broken but can't force a fix.
- Investors and the media don't understand the real, fixable bottleneck.

<!--slide-->

## Why Now?
- AI/compute demand is exploding; the world wants a CUDA alternative.
- AMD is the only viable challenger, but lacks trust and developer credibility.
- The timing is right—small, strategic action can unlock huge value.

<!--slide-->

## What Traditional Activism Misses
- **Shareholder activism:** Has legal force but lacks technical depth.
- **Open source advocacy:** Has technical insight but no leverage.
- The result: Neither can break the deadlock alone; the status quo persists.

<!--slide-->

## Our Solution: Developer–Owner Leverage
- Developers buy shares, set public technical demands, and coordinate votes.
- Shareholder rights + technical legitimacy = real force.
- Community governance: open, transparent, and forkable.
- AI amplifies reach—content, analysis, and engagement at scale.

<!--slide-->

## Traction and Team
- Team: Solo founder using AI for content, outreach, and technical engagement.
- Minimum shares secured—resolution will be filed.
- Active public docs, developer priorities, and coalition-building at [UnlockGPU.com](https://unlockgpu.com/).

<!--slide-->

## Go-to-Market & Leverage
- Target developer communities, open source, and credible technical investors.
- Use public resolutions and media to force the conversation.
- Recruit early developer–owners and respected technical allies.
- AI powers spreadable content, engagement, and analysis with minimal resources.

<!--slide-->

## Milestones
- 2025: File resolution, launch developer coalition, secure endorsements.
- 2026: Win the public vote, negotiate with AMD, force real budget and governance reforms.
- 2026+: Expand the model—apply this approach to other tech bottlenecks if successful.

<!--slide-->

## The Ask: Credibility, Not Capital
- **We're not raising money—your support isn't a donation or investment in us.**
- Join by buying any amount of AMD shares on the public market and pledging your vote.
- What matters: your name, technical reputation, and public support.
- Every credible supporter increases our leverage.
- *Become a founder-ally. Your credibility is our leverage. The shares give us the vote.*

<!--slide-->

## Why UnlockGPU Wins
- Asymmetric leverage: AI, developer credibility, and SEC rules make this a high-impact, low-cost movement.
- Huge upside if AMD unlocks its stack—supporters share in the value created for the entire ecosystem.
- Model is forkable and repeatable—can be used for other industry choke points.

<!--slide-->

## Join Us
- Be part of the first open-source governance experiment at public-company scale.
- Early supporters shape the agenda and become recognized founder-allies.
- *Own where you code. Vote where you build. Unlock the future of AI compute.*
